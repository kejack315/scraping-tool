10,Joyce¡¯s disgraceful Qantas,"Not even remotely interested having this morning had my Business Class seat booked August 2022 on a flight from Sydney to Cairns DOWN GRADED, yes DOWNGRADED, to economy class. Flying with Qantas used to feel like a privileged, romantic adventure. Not any more. These days flying with Qantas is a humiliating ordeal.

Not surprising Qantas world airline ranking has dropped to 19 from the top ten and that Qantas was the very worthy recipient of the CHOICE organisation¡¯s 2022 Shonky Award.", July 2023,Legroom: 30 Seat comfort: 10 In-flight Entertainment: 10 Customer service: 30 Value for money: 10 Cleanliness: 30 Check-in and boarding: 10 Food and Beverage: 10

10,"Qantas, the success is not when you do this business, but when you are happy to do it.","Absolutely horrible!! My suggestions are to AVOID any business with qantas.
I booked online flight to Thessaloniki in Greece one week ago. During the online process in a favour to complete my flight reservation, I choose the journey from Thessaloniki to Sydney in a duration of 26h and 40m and proceed to complete. However, after I paid the full amount and I received the confirmation e-ticket, the inbound journey was clearly showing almost 3days trip (leaving Thessaloniki on 30.9.23 and arriving in Sydney on 2.10.23), yes 3days trip via London.
I immediately called customer service to request a full refund, after an hour of explaining the situation (and 1h 13m) being on hold I was instructed that a refund will be less (around $250) from the ticket value, and I agree on that since I had no other choice.
After 3 days, I received refund of $3,151.92 from the ticket that I paid $3,964.22 and I lost $812.30

20,"Very average, definitely not worth the cost if paying actual dollars","I travelled to Queenstown on Business Class with a friend via a Qantas points redemption. Overall I would have to say the experience was very average and barely adequate for a 3 hr trans-Tasman flight. I was certainly glad it was a redemption, as I would have been very disappointed if I had paid the $1600 price for this flight.

The only difference between this flight and Qantas domestic class appeared to be the champagne and more (frequent) drink service. To Qantas' credit, the Jacquart Cuvee champagne was quite nice and the pumpkin salad I had was quite nice. The accompaniments (biscuits and dessert) were very basic and below the standard I am used to on Virgin domestic business service. The beef and chicken dishes offered to other passengers were not to my taste at all and looked to be quite sloppy, below the standard expected for international business.

Some other points of note, firstly the check-in process was very slow. The ""priority"" queue was long and if you can use the automatic machines (for economy) it probably would have been quicker. As we were checking in skis and had a lot of bags (the main reason for travelling in business) we used the manual check-in. The process took over 20 mins. As a result of this and the long ""priority"" security line (not Qantas' fault, I know) we had very little time to spend in the lounge. The lounge time was further reduced by having to take a bus to a remote parking bay, which also meant there was no priority boarding and the flight also left and arrived late.

The food offerings in the international business lounge were similarly less extensive than what I have experienced in the past in the Air NZ lounge and Virgin domestic lounges, although still acceptable.

I also felt that the business seat was more upright in its normal position than the Virgin 737 business seat, and the recline was more limited (although I couldn't find exact figures, the seat pitch is 1"" more with Virgin).

Qantas also forgot to load the business noise-cancelling headphones on this flight and offered a 2000 point credit as a result (which was promptly delivered without further request, to their credit).

All up, I felt that Virgin domestic business was slightly better, even with the lack of IFE, footrest and USB charging, due to the more comfortable seat (at least to me), better food, and better lounges.

Unfortunately there are no wide-body flights to Queenstown but it is clear the 737 service falls very, very short of normal international business (i.e. wide-body) service. No tablecloth, the meal is presented on a single tray instead of individual plates, not even drip coffee available (instant only), and a very basic seat. Compared to trans-Tasman business I've experienced with Air NZ (old 767 and 777) and Emirates (A380) it felt more like premium economy. It's also disappointing that Qantas don't offer Wifi on international 737 flights.", June 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
10,Quantas is getting worst day by day. Very expensive for the quality of the service,"I had flight from Rome to Sydney with stop in Perth, the first 15 hours flight was poor in terms of customer care and quality service.
Firstly the hostess in our sector was very rude, in 15 h she never smiled to the customers and when we asked something to her she was answering very rud. Secondly the food was ridiculous. I paid 1095 Euros to have a poor lunch, How can a flight from Rome with most of the customers on board from Italy gave Pasta that we all known how poor will be the quality... So We decided to get chicken salad and really I never had a meal worst than that, probably KFC made had better quality.
Then you dont even provide a dinner, we had to wait till the morning after to have a ridiculous breakfast made by unknown sausages and a stuff that was meant to be scrumble eggs but really you could do better! Even China Airlines provide a better service to their customers.
Also we were sitting close to the engine and the noise of that motor was insane and as you try to save as much money you can, you don't even provide earplugs or the normal bag with a toothbrush and all the necessaire to made customers confortable during a 15 hours flight.
Then once in Perth we had more than 2 hours delay and again on the flight to Sydney the meal was ridiculous.

I booked your company thinking was a good and customers care company but was a sad mistake.
Definitelly I will never flight again with you and will try to convince more people possible to spend better their money.", June 2023,Legroom: 30 Seat comfort: 30 In-flight Entertainment: 20 Customer service: 10 Value for money: 10 Cleanliness: 30 Check-in and boarding: 30 Food and Beverage: 10
10,Avoid at all cost,"By far the worst flight experience I've ever had and I firmly believe this company is a scam. My luggage was lost in February and despite following all instructions that were given to me by Qantas team members , I have yet to receive a refund for my lost items.

My bag was lost on my flight and upon landing in Australia I immediatly reported it missing and received a file reference number. I was told my bag was in Dallas TX and would arrive the following day. The next day I called to check on the status of my bag and was told it was ""delayed but on its way"".

My bag never arrived for the entirety of my trip. I was told to check in at the Dallas airport during my departure home to see if my bag was there, it wasn't. I was instructed to call customer service, the agent attempted to end my call without resolution because there is ""a time limit per call"". I push back and asked for resolution. The agent told me my bag would be shipped to my home address, it never came. I reached back out and was told to fill out a claims form to receive a refund for my lost items, and that I would be receiving an email shortly providing me with a case number. I was instructed to email my claims form back to this email address. The email never came.

I called customer service, after an hour of explaining the situation I was given the email address and instructed to submit my claims form with my file reference number. I got no response. I reached back out, no response.

Today I spent the last hour and 8 minutes with a customer service agent who told me my file reference number doesn't exist (yet every other agent was able to use it with no issue), then put me on a ""brief hold"" which lasted 20 minutes, then the call ended abruptly with no resolution.

I am at a loss of words with how disorganized this company is. I'm also extremely frustrated with having to put forth hours of my time and effort on a situation that has a very simple solution. I've been fighting for my refund since February, have spoken with over 20 Qantas staff members throughout this process and continue to get nowhere.", February 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

I was meant to get a Green Tier with all the consequent perks, but never got it. It¡¯s been almost a year, however Qantas ¡®Customer Insult Service¡¯ wouldn¡¯t even bother to do anything.

Been calling and sending emails to the customer service for a month now in vain. Every time they seem to be unaware of what¡¯s been happening and it¡¯s like something new they¡¯ve never heard before.

On top of that, they hung up on my call in the middle of the conversation or make excuses as if the phone call was breaking up.

Overall, total disrespect and humiliation from this joke customer service.

10,Qantas gets worse day by day,"My husband and I returned home from Brisbane on QF 0937 on the 26th June. Bear in mind this is a 5 hour trip.

Firstly, the plane was so old and the seats so small that it is getting ridiculous. If anyone is slightly on the heavy side, it is uncomfortable for them and also for those having to sit next to them.

The aisle is so narrow that is is almost impossible for two people to pass each other especially if the plane is full, which our plane was, as they can't duck into a spare space to let the person pass. It's not OK for someone to rub themselves against you. No way!

The Customer Service Manager (Darren) in my opinion was out of line in regards to a couple of his comments.
Firstly, he told the passengers to be polite and respectful to each other. Seriously Qantas?
Then he told the passengers that if anyone abused the alcohol he would 'cut it off'.
I am absolutely sick to death of 'WOKE' and he needs to be advised by management that these sort of comments are outrageous and not necessary.

Lastly, Qantas continues to cut it's services every time you fly.

30,"Once proud, with great staff let down by on time record",I travel regularly domestically for business and while airlines are struggling to recover from Covid.

The staff do need to be acknowledged for continuing under trying times to retain the high qantas professionalism.

I need a book for the rest. Will never EVER out of principle travel with Qantas again. Even if they offer cheap flights. Most un-Australian company ever.

50,5 star review for Alliance Airlines staff operating QF1997,"This Qantas flight between Cairns and Uluru was operated by Alliance Airlines. It left on time (1.10pm) and arrived on time (28 June 2023). FlightRadar24 shows consistent on time performance for the past week. My recent flights on another airline 4 weeks earlier were 90 mins and 60 mins delayed, so I appreciated the on time performance. The Fokker 100, with an all economy, 2 x 3 seat configuration, is not the newest kid on the block, but it¡¯s reliable. The Alliance cabin crew were exceptional, so a big shout out to Jayden and Mosi (apologies if I¡¯ve mis-spelt your names!). Professional, engaging and clearly loving their jobs. About a 3 hour flight , with a pre-packaged ham and Bavarian mustard sandwich, or fresh fruit, served with juice, wine, tea/coffee and water. A second round of drinks were offered after the meal service, which was appreciated - no need to use the cabin crew call button. Not much to see at 34,000 feet as the unseasonal rain and extensive cloud band covering central Australia obscured the ground view. Smooth flight, with minimal bumps as we descended through the cloud cover prior to landing at Ayers Rock Airport, so thanks to the flight crew. The Fokker 100 may be old, but it sure beats the hell out of a Dash 8 turbo-prop that Qantas uses on many of its regional routes.

10,Terrible treatment,"I had booked and paid for 2 business class tickets in Dec 22 (using points plus pay). Boarding passes for myself and my sister were issued at luggage check-in. Upon arrival to business class lounge we were called up and told that only one of us could fly business, I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was put on to Karen (by phone). Karen gave me several reasons, all unsatisfactory but apologised and assured me that the points and funds difference would be credited to my account. She further said by way of compensation she would offer me a $500 credit for the inconvenience. I enquired if this was to be cash, she said no it was a credit to be used towards flights only.
Karen also subsequently met me at the gate before boarding and reiterated same.

I was so distressed and affected by this bad start to my special Christmas gift holiday to my sister, that I ended up having to go to the hospital in Singapore. and I was very ill for the first 2 days of our 10 day trip All of which can be evidenced. I am not seeking compensation for this aspect but it should be known so that you have a complete picture of what occurred and the knock on effect.

Qantas have shunted me from one department to another. First Customer Service (who apparently have no phone number), then Reservations Dept, then Frequent Flyer loyalty program. Each department tells me it is not under their purvue and that I need evidence of what Karen offered. I was told to go to the airport (a 4+ hour round trip for me) and to try to locate Karen at the airport. I explained that I would not be able to get to the business class lounge without a ticket and clearing customs - that Karen may not be working that day and that there may be many Karen's who work for qantas. I was told I should have taken a reference number for the offer made by Karen. Well I did not realise I needed to make a recording or get an affidavit from her on the day as I took her at face value, assumed (and still do believe) that she made this offer in good faith. I am now told after wasting days /weeks on this that the complaint has been closed. I was not advised of this via email and no explanation given, they just decided to close it. Astonishing! Now when I make an enquiry I keep getting replies stating the reference number does not exist, presumably because they unilaterally decided to close it.

Qantas need to honour their promise and obligation. ie
1. The correct amount of Frequent flyer loyalty points to be returned to my account (some points have been reinstated and then removed and I am querying the actual amount is correct).
2. For the compensation amount of $500 (for use towards flights ) to be added to my account as promised.", June 2023,Legroom: 30 Seat comfort: 10 In-flight Entertainment: 40 Customer service: 10 Value for money: 10 Cleanliness: 40 Check-in and boarding: 10 Food and Beverage: 10
10,Absolutely rude service,"My review relates to Flight QF1043 from Broome to Sydney on 30 June 2022 & concerns the flight attendant, David Crandel (if this is his name?), in the Business Class cabin where I was seated in 1A. Let me recount in detail the unacceptable experience I suffered on your flight at the hands of this employee.

I boarded this flight, which had been delayed, and sat in my allocated seat. As it happened, the woman seated next to me (I thought it was to be empty, according to the seat booking) had already taken up all the space in the overhead locker above, so the female flight attendant had to help me find some space in another locker, as I was sitting in Row 1 where no floor luggage is allowed. I will come back to this later. I note there is no priority boarding for Business Class at Broome airport, so my embarkation took a much longer time than usual when travelling Business Class (where I note, airline companies make most of their money, even domestically).

The aircraft departed and soon after (as I was seated in 1A) Mr Crandel came and asked me what meal I would prefer, the beef or chicken. I responded that I was vegetarian. He became indignant and asked me had I specifically requested a vegetarian meal. I said that this option had not been available in the online booking app where I had bought this flight ticket, but that my Qantas profile had this detail (you can check). He said, in a condescending tone, that he would see what he could do, and said that there might be an omelette available in the Economy cabin. I responded politely that that would be fine, as I am not vegan. He then asked me would I like to have a drink in the meantime, and I responded in the affirmative. He brought me a small bottle of the Grant Burge.

I then waited over 35 minutes while he fed & wined the other 11 passengers in the Business Class cabin. He did not speak to me at all during this time. He went back to the galley and was pulling drawers in and out, so I got out of my seat and approached him, and again politely asked if he¡¯d had any luck in acquiring a meal for me. He appeared to be annoyed, and said he¡¯s been very busy and that he hadn¡¯t had time to chase up my particular needs. I asked him for his name and he refused to provide it and he appeared to have no name tag. I told him he¡¯d only provided alcohol for me, at which point he grabbed the half empty bottle of Grant Burgeons from my tray. I then said that I¡¯d paid over $2000 for this flight, and that angry mood further escalated and he shouted at me that I was bullying him and he would call the Federal Police and have me escorted off the plane and charged. when I asked (facetiously) what I would be charged with? He said bullying him. I repeated, that in fact he was bullying me and at fault with depriving me of a meal and only plying me with alcohol and that he would be reprimanded for wasting the time of the Federal Police. He then became extremely aggressive and ordered me back to my seat. I then said I wanted to speak to the Captain to First Officer, at which point he shouted, ¡°They won¡¯t see you!¡± and again threatened me with calling the Federal Police.

At this point in the commotion, another flight attendant appeared, ¡°Libby¡± - I think the senior flight attendant from the Economy Cabin. She told me his name, after I asked her repeatedly, and she asked him to provide me with a chicken meal so I could pick off the chicken and eat the vegetables, and the cheese etc., which he begrudgingly did. Libby brought me a glass of Chardonnay and tried her best to calm the situation, but said she did not want to get involved or give me her surname.

Coming in to land, after the seat belt sign came on, Mr Crandel did not take my bags on the floor at my feet, which I thought was mandatory in Row 1 when landing? WHS?

The whole experience of encountering such a rude and unbalanced flight attendant as Mr Crandel, was completely unacceptable.

At time of boarding, they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium FF members. On the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight. The plane was comfortable, and the seating was good. The meal was good overall, but we were not offered any re-fills or a second beverage. Basically, the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service. Following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up, even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service. Finally, the bags well again no business priority, the bag came out amongst all the general baggage.

I was told that the system has been closed and they cannot serve me and I have to book for another flight. I had to look for another flight somewhere else as the rate was high in Qantas.

30,Rebooked from a cancelled Jetstar flight - was certainly not the upgrade we'd hoped,"So, Jetstar cancelled our booked flight, but after some slight issues got us on to this flight. Yay, we thought. We were homeward bound. Not without some chaos. First, the flight was delayed for 20 minutes. Fine, no big deal. Then, it was delayed another 20 minutes which was slightly irritating, especially since there was no explanations/apologies/staff to contact until the pilot made an announcement after take-off. But, then they changed the gate at the last minute and made all passengers travel to the other side of the terminal. They then announced on the plane that the catering on-board was limited in order to prevent further delays - I appreciate this is a no-win situation and passengers will be unhappy whatever happens, but this just seemed like the cherry on top.

The crew was kind enough and did their best with the hand that we were dealt, but was still not pleasant. A lot of disgruntled and tired passengers. Oh, and we paid for extra legroom seats with Jetstar, and weren't able to get them on Qantas. Understandable, but still another irritation.

If they managed it properly and made the cancelations earlier then my mom would have been able to spend 2 extra days with us. They have no proper communication.

The boarding gate at Christchurch opened late. Boarding was therefore chaotic.
When all were onboard the flight was then awaiting a de-icing machine.
When the Qantas de-icer arrived it did not work.
Then another hour sitting waiting for an Air NZ de-icer.
Eventually took off over 2 hours late.
Arrived in Sydney and no available gate to disembark and so sat on the runway for more delay.
No assistance on disembarking. Had to go through security screening. Bit silly that as had just come off of a Qantas International flight.
Incoming international flight security screening took ages with (once again) only one scanner working.
After screening found that the flight was gone.
Nearby international transit desk closed.
A major task to find the only open transit desk which was on the other side of the terminal - with no signage.
At transit desk only one person working - with a queue of 20+ waiting. (Poor employee. Felt sorry for her with no attempt by Qantas to help).
Eventually told I was re-routed via Tokyo.
Arrived Bkk 14 hours late.
NO baggage at airport.
More lost time reporting lost baggage.

10,"rude ground staff, terrible customer service","Booking the tickets was fine, its getting them to issue the eticket that was a problem. Contacting customer service to resolve the issues was also bad. It took them over 3 months to send me my eticket and even then my connecting flight was changed by them without informing me. Spend another week calling them non stop to fix the problem. I won't go in full details as if you look up other travel forums they are well documented. This is the result of qantas outsourcing to call centres in South Africa, Philippines or India where they just follow the script and are very rude.
The ground staff at Sydney airport where just plain rude, aggressive and lazy. The complimentary bus transfer that qantas operate for its customers to travel between T1 and T3 was chaotic. The two male staff where too busy talking or playing with their phones. So when the bus arrives its a mad scramble for everyone to push in line and get on board. On the return trip back I was put onto a later connecting flight even though the flight wasn't departing for another hour by the time I got to the gate. Only found this out when I was at the international to domestic connection counter that I found this out. Furthermore a specific staff (attached photo) who was guiding the waiting line on that morning was extremely rude, not helpful and was brushing people off so she can continue talking to her colleague. I have already logged a complaint to qantas (including her name and the time and date she was stationed) about her but never receive a reply back. I received friendly and helpful interaction from the staff at westjet when flying internally in Canada then the staff at qantas and yet qantas is supposedly the better airline?

20,A letdown - Inconsistent standards across different international flights,"I had a pretty enjoyable trip from Singapore to Melbourne. However, the experience that Qantas offers does not seem to be consistent. The trip from Sydney to Singapore was a letdown.

1. The crew members need to be more attentive. We were among the last rows being served the meal. While we could understand that sometimes certain food would not longer be available in the cart, it would not be acceptable when the passenger was handed the meal was given without any cutlery and was told to wait for the bread to come. Of course, it ended up the crew member forgot after it after almost a 10-minute wait. In addition, no one responded after the 'assistance' button was pressed. We had to catch the attention of a crew member who happened to be attending to another passenger. and that was another 5-minute wait.

2. Safety - Lack of vigilance: The overhead compartment above my seat was fully packed. When a passenger took her bag out to unpack, she did not close the cover of the compartment. It was more than 5 minutes of the flight time. This could be very dangerous, especially for the passengers who sat below or near the compartment. HOWEVER, none of the crew members went around to look out for such.

3. It was a A380 plane with double decks. The 'hidden' passage way for the crew members were situation besides the toilets. While we understand the crew members need to access this area, there were occasional crowds around that area. This could be done more quietly and with more consideration of passengers seated around.

Professionalism of the crew and standards could definitely be better.", June 2023,Legroom: 40 Seat comfort: 40 In-flight Entertainment: 20 Customer service: 10 Value for money: 30 Cleanliness: 40 Check-in and boarding: 50 Food and Beverage: 40
10,No seat selection available in advance - even if willing to pay,"Bought seats for my wife and me 3-4 months in advance. Did NOT purchase through discount web site, but on Qantas web site. Economy seats were roughly $1,500 each. Was not allowed to select seats at the time of purchase, but figured I could do so for a fee later, although their web site says that seat selection is complimentary.

As is often the case, time got away from me and I didn't deal with it until a few days before departure. Couldn't do so either on their app or online. I even had signed up for their frequent flyer program.

Checked in online and then saw that our seats were both center seats and quite a few rows apart. My wife and I are 66 years old and I typically will pay up to $200/seat to get exit row or bulk head on an international flight.

At least at the airport the Qantas clerk got us together, but neither seat was aisle as we requested. The guy on the aisle must have slept 8 of the 15.5 hours of the flight, and we both ended up climbing over him by stepping on the arm rests...two 66 year olds, lol!

20,Long delay to and from Perth,"I¡¯m disappointed with #Qantas after both my flights to and from Exmouth were delayed by 5hrs.

Despite the flights being 10 days apart it appears as though there have been mechanical faults with the plane both times, necessitating both a plane swap and crew swap.

Nor does this appear to be a one off, as another passenger on this flight stated his plane from Perth to Exmouth 5 days ago also had a mechanical failure and long delay.

One failure would be a coincidence. Two seems problematic. Three in 10 days appears to be a pattern.

Not only that but there is minimal support and facilities at Learmonth airport - difficult when you are travelling with a two year old and Qantas only communicates the delay late (when you¡¯re already at the airport)", June 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

10,Qantas took no responsibility for staff & systems fail costing customer $thousands.,"We booked a return family flights to Europe 10 months in advance to get a good price and availability. Later, a flight was cancelled so I called Qantas to rebook.
But behind the scenes something was wrong with the new booking. I don't know if it was a staff error or technical error, but the new booking only existed in one of their systems but not another. I had a feeling something was wrong because I couldn't see the booking when I logged into the Qantas online portal. Over several months I called Qantas about 10 times and spent over 100 hours on hold waiting for customer service as I tried to make sure our booking was valid. Each time, I was assured that the booking was fine. The customer service agent would re-send the itinerary to put me at ease.
The day before our flight, I called again because I couldn't complete online check-in or book a meal online. Again, I was assured the booking was fine and I should sort it out at the airport. But I called again and kept asking questions until eventually at 2am the staff member looked in a different system and found that my booking didn't exist.
I asked for alternative flights but nothing was available to anywhere in southern Europe for a week or so. This wasn't an option for us since we needed to arrive on time for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday.
Qantas offered no alternative apart from a few thousand points as compensation for these mistakes with their systems.
We ended up booking the last available seats with Thai Airways. Actually, I found this flight to be very comfortable. The food was good, staff were kind, and the change in Bangkok worked well.

Emirates has continued with the traditional full tray of airline food and repeat beverage service. On a long flight meal service is one of the things that passes the time. To be served something more suitable to a short domestic flight was a shock.
I suppose the idea is to encourage passengers to book premium or business. For me I will just book another airline.
I really hate to be treated like dirt.
The inflight entertainment service was glitchy. My screen kept freezing and would and the touch screen often would not respond. The cabin crew tried to help by rebooting. No difference. Others around me had the same problem so this must be a system issue. It was impossible to select and watch a movie. Fortunately I had brought a book. Again Emirates were vastly better.
I left the flights both ways just seething.

10,I was charged twice and customer service is terrible,"I booked a flight at the beginning of the month. A trip I¡¯ve been waiting to make for decades to visit family and was finally able to do so.
After I made my booking, I realized I needed to make a slight change to my itinerary. I called Qantas and they suggested I rebook and that my first booking would be cancelled and I would not be charged.
I did as advised and all seemed well.
A few days later, I looked at my bank account, which I do most mornings, and throughout the day, because I live paycheck to paycheck and saw my account was overdrawn by almost $5,000. I quickly saw what had happened : I was charged for my original flight that was cancelled and that I was told I wouldn¡¯t be charged for by Qantas and also for my new booking.
I called Qantas immediately and proceeded to spend the next 4 hours on the phone talking with different Customer Service works and hearing something different from each person.
The last person I spoke with actually gave me a case number and told me the refund would be proceeded in 3-5 days.
That night, I received an email from Qantas saying my refund was being processed and it usually to 6-8 weeks.
My account is still overdrawn and my savings account is now frozen. I¡¯ve been calling the BBB and the FAA and emailing any email I can find for Qantas. No money and no response.
I¡¯m unable to pay my bills right now and I¡¯m getting no help from Qantas despite this being completely their fault.
I haven¡¯t even flown with them and already I have a very negative view of the company.
I¡¯d advise anyone against supporting a company that won¡¯t do whatever they can to right a wrong they created.
Really disappointing to say the least.

The lady was very helpful and after about 10 minutes she put us on standby for an erlier flight( no guarantee that we would get on) Fortunately we got seats on the 1005am flight and made it to Sydney to get our connecting flight.

50,Business class A330 - Sydney. -Seoul ( Incheon ) - Sydney,"Flew Sydney to Seoul (Incheon) return QF87 and QF88 on this route re-introduced in late 2022.

The A330 business class cabin layout provides good privacy on the even numbered window seats with a little less privacy on the odd numbered window seats.

Full lay flat bed with comfortable mattress and pillow and blanket. Pyjamas and amenity bags provided however you may need to ask for pyjamas if you would like them on the outgoing sector as this is a day flight.

After leaving the Qantas International Lounge boarding is generally quick if you board during the priority boarding prior to general boarding commencing.

Greeted as I entered the aircraft and shortly after you take your seat you are again greeted by the cabin crew and a pre-departure drink is offered.

The crew are very friendly and still maintain a professional but relaxed service.

Meal orders were taken with some of the more popular (seared snapper dish) being unavailable by the time my order was taken in row 4 however the other options of which I chose Bannockburn chicken that was enjoyable.

A nice choice of wines, spirits , soft drinks juice and water to compliment the meals and snacks provided throughout the flight.

Dinner service was offered later in the flight prior to arrival into Seoul.

The inflight entertainment screen is a good size and offers plenty of movies , television programs, music Podcasts throughout the over 10hr flight.

Sarah , Marie , Louise and Travis were the flight crew attending to the business cabin on QF87 with Travis coming through the cabin shortly before landing to thank passengers for their business and ensuring that the service received was excellent.

10,Qantas the most delayed airline ever.,"Been in and out of the country for the last 3 months.
Everytime qantas is Late. At least 3 hours. Causing me to miss other connecting flights.
Once 2 weeks ago travelling to Sydney from Brisbane then Manila.
Flights from Brisbane was 3 hours late. Off course when I got to Sydney I lost the Manila flight.
The rude lady at the desk said they would not provide a hotel because wasn't their fault..(who's fault was it then)
Then they flew me to Bali then to Manila. So I arrived 12 hours late.
The point is if you don't care about arriving on time..EVER!!!!
Then go with qantas. But if you have business meetings, important things to attend.
STAY AWAY FROM qantas. They are cutting costs in a way that the airline is suffering. And the customer service is a joke, rude.

40,A good international flight,"I get so used to grumbling about Qantas these days that it is nice to write a good review. This is a new service non-stop to Seoul operated by the A330. The plane was not full so I had 2 empty seats next to me. The food was a highlight - 2 hot meals were served with choices and nice wines. The service was also friendly and polite - I must say the non-Anglo background staff are much nicer than the whites. The entertainment was good as well.

My only issue is the filthy toilets. Many other carriers check the toilets often and clean them through out the flight. Qantas do not.

Then another text confirming another 2 delays before I was then rerouted to Melbourne instead of Sydney and take the international connection from there. Not complaining about that but just the inconvenience of that. The same happened for my connection back to Canberra - another delay at Brisbane but pilots made up for it with a nice apology. I am not one to fret about delays as I understand the many behind the flights activities that are happening, but would be great if Qantas can help to minimise this or address these challenges so as to provide a hassle free, stress free flight. As a QF member, I choose to fly Qantas for many reason but especially so for the points etc - so Qantas, please keep improving your service.

10,4th Strike out of 6 flights. What has happened to our flag airline?,"Something is very broken at Qantas. We pay premium fare money for poor service. I can get the same flight for $64 with other airlines. Two people return over $1000.

Boarded, all good tarmac out, on the run way, did not even get to full power and drove down the runway to go to service bay. Should be ok after engineers check it out. Thirty minutes later off loaded and had to walk from gate 28 to gate 6, Change planes. Meant to arrive in Hobart approx 1630. Arrived about 1900.

Cabin staff were excellent. Pilot could not apologise often enough but that doesn't solve the root issues.

The snack are revolting. Bring back cheese and bickies.

No alcohol before 1600. Some of us have been up all night and just want to relax.

Melb - Cairns.
3 attempts at take off. Change planes. No meal, limited service in contradiction to T& C's Arrived very late.

Melb - Hobart Return
4 Hour delay departure Melb arrived in Hobart after midnight. Hotel closed.
Should have been offered Qantas Club (as happened in Singapore before.) but nothing.
Went to service desk late and asked why not? They offered me a voucher but all cafes shut. Not lunch no tea,

10,Terrible Service!,"Qantas was disappointing. It is considered a top airline, but my first experience with them on a Brisbane to Los Angeles trip was underwhelming.

The plane was old and lacked adapters for charging devices, with only one USB port. Additionally, the entertainment options were limited.

When requesting a drink, the crew would often bring just a can without a cup or ice, which was inconvenient.

The dinner consisted of lamb with mashed potatoes, but the meat was chewy and the taste was unpleasant. The meal lacked accompanying items like bread, butter, salad, or dessert. For breakfast, served an hour before landing, the crew informed the last three rows that hot meals had run out, offering only granola and yogurt instead. This was surprising and not ideal, as I have never encountered a complete shortage of meals on a flight before.

Considering the extra cost I paid for Qantas and my expectation of excellent customer service, I found their performance to be subpar compared to other airlines I have flown with.", May 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,Shocking baggage service in Hobart,"This was the last leg of a roundtrip to Samoa where we had used points. We flew domestically from Sydney to Hobart via MEL. The first flight was delayed but we made our connection. The in flight service was fine with a nice meal and good service. But when we got to Hobart no bags... a few others were in the same situation. There was no-one to help. Yep Hobart is not a huge place, but this is a capital city airport with multiple QF flights a day. The bag conveyor just stopped and nothing. We had to walk up to the counter area and scan a QR code to lodge our own baggage claim. This process gives you a number to call which I tried to do the next day as I needed to know where the bags were as I was due to leave for another trip 2 days later... I called 10 times over 2 hours and no answer or way to leave a message. In the end, I had to call the airport authority to ask them to pass a message to Qantas baggage. Then I got the good news that the bags had been found and both had flown in the next morning. A courier was despatched and arrived at my house at 2pm with ONE bag. Where is the other one??? The courier had on idea. Two hours later, the second bag was delivered by the same courier. The tags show that both bags came in on the SAME flight. Qantas are incompetent.

10,The worst experience I have ever had with a company from start to finish!,"My friends and I were booking flights to Perth. We had booked a one-way flight for $350 and the next
day we saw a Qantas deal for $175 each way if you were paying return. My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission and eventually refunded to me. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls from multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer.
We all had the flights confirmed in the Qantas app and it said the credit was in our accounts. I never received any information to say I owed additional money, no emails, no calls and nothing in my online account or app.
We were able to check in to the airport using the app for our flight into Perth and had no issues.
When I was in Perth, I attempted to check in for my return flight to which it said I was checked in but would have to collect a boarding pass from the service desk at the airport. I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk called Elisabeth provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me and to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. They said it wasn¡¯t their problem and it was up to me, even though they had let me fly into another state without telling me I still had money outstanding on my return flight. I asked for her full name which she refused and said to call her just 'Lizzy'. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' even though she used it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well. I asked for her employee number and she refused. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said no one could help me. My friends were able to check in normally the next day and returned home with no issues. They did not have to pay additional funds as I did.
I tried to provide Qantas with feedback which I did twice and have not had a response in over two weeks. I have never had a more traumatic, draining or stressful experience with a company.

10,Never again,"After spending a lovely 5 day holiday in Surfers Paradise with my family (2 adults and 2 children), we used public transport to get to Brisbane airport, this was easy to do and cheap (took about 2 and 1/2 hours).

We arrived at the Qantas check-in and we couldn't check-in our bags. Yes we were super early (~6 hours before our flight). But with no one at the check-in we had no idea when we could. My partner tried ringing Qantas but got no response. There was little to no communication from them apart from when my partner had checked us in the previous day, and this was to say that due to flooding the check-in was via the kiosks. (Seemed plausible until we arrived - kiosks were on the 4th floor).

Plane was late leaving in the end, meant to leave at 6.40pm, didn't depart until close to 8pm, again not communicated this. Just kept saying that boarding was soon.

After sitting down in the seats we realized we had made a bad decision, seats super narrow, no leg room and the belt was only just long enough. Are only short and skinny people allowed to fly, since I felt very uncomfortable during the next 4 hours of the flight.

The meal was pretty good, that's about the only positive on this flight.

The headset had a bad wire connection, the touch screen was very slow to operate, could hardly hear the communication from captain although this could be due to the very noisy plane.

To sum up our experience, we had expected more from the Australians national carrier, but nope it's just a glorified Jetstar. We will now and forever use AirNZ, since all the problems we had with Qantas was not an issue with AirNZ. Cost between these two flights weren't alot and we didn't want to fly Jetstar for all the reasons we experienced on Qantas.

So we had to use our own money again, we had to rebook another coach for an additional ?88 we had to rearrange taxis and pay more.

It was detrimental on our health. It took us nearly a week to adjust back again and obviously those 6 hours didn't help. It was poor communication on the delay. We had nowhere to stay but in plastic chairs for 12 hours. There were bodied sleeping on the floor, steps behind/beside us.

I've flown with so many other airlines and they have been so considerate in delays. However THIS company you couldn't get blood out of a stone.

So here is the kicker...
Qantas offered us GBP53.92 (AUD100) between the two of us. It's absolutely pathetic a big company like this offering so petty amounts. This didn't even cover our two drinks. So if you get delayed don't expect the world because you will get fisted.

I have pledged to myself that it is my very LAST TIME EVER to fly on Qantas. Their customer service is nothing but disappointing and callous. They never admit to making mistakes and never own up to responsibilities. NEVER fly on Qantas ever again.

My connecting flight from Los Angeles to Seattle via Alaska Airlines (codeshare partner) was never booked and confirmed despite their email confirmation sent to me when I paid for the entire itinerary. It was one hell of nightmare for the two of us getting stuck at LAX when Alaska Airlines had no tickets for us to board the connecting flight. We were unable to board and ended up getting stuck at LAX for 12 long hours to finally catch the next available flights after exhaustive work done by the passengers (me and my wife). Qantas failed to pass our ticketing information to Alaska Airlines the entire time since tickets were purchased and paid for a month before the departure date. Despite Qantas email confirmation explicitly confirming the Alaska connecting flight, it was false and incorrect. Alaska has its own unique booking system requiring totally different booking record numbers from Qantas booking record numbers. Yet Qantas failed to convert to Alaska unique system the entire time. When I reported the horrific experience to Qantas post-flight, they had no sympathy, no admission to error, and obviously no desire to own up to their mistake. I submitted all evidence to Qantas which only went to a black hole.

When I went back to my seat to have breakfast the crew was very quick to greet me and say good morning and bring me some juice of my choice before my breakfast came.

10,Qantas do not give a toss about service!,"As regular travellers to Perth for many years to visit family, usually with Qatar who are excellent, we thought we'd try the non stop Qantas flight in premium economy at ?2500 each, to avoid any possible COVID stops. Travelling in December 2022 returning January 23.

We booked exactly 11 months early through dial a flight (Tara) who were excellent, and booked our seats, one of the pairs. About 3 months later I went on to manage my booking to find our seats were not booked as we would have to wait to book them the day before flying. Spoke to dial a flight who were as bemused as we were but suggested we pay the balance early to see if that worked, it did not! I was on the manage my booking every day for 3 months before a pair of seats were available outbound and 6 weeks later I managed to get return seats. All the time their website was saying book your flights then book your seats! Oh no you can't! I am still waiting a reply to my complaint from Qantas Customer Service that I sent in June 2022.

At Heathrow we checked in and got through security etc. to find that our flight had no take off time. After a while it said we were delayed 10 hours and we all trouped off to the Qantas desk to be told a pilot was either ill or out of hours. We received a ?5 voucher each as compensation. We booked into a lounge for ?72 only to soon find the screen said we were to go to gate for boarding. We eventually took off about 5 hours late. Flight not too bad and plane ok, premium seats are wider and a little extra legroom but entertainment very poor and food not very good. Staff were very good but this is a very long time to be sat on a plane. I thought I'd got bedsores on my bottom after 12 hours.

On the return flight they had moved us from a pair to the 3 seats in the middle. They didn't bother telling us so we only found out on the plane! Staff said our seats had problems with the entertainment system (it probably bored itself to death!). A lady then sits in our original seats, tries both and watched the screen in both until she put her feet up and slept. Staff chose to ignore my complaints. My lamb shank was not bad on the flight but the rest of the meal wasn't great agan. Breakfast was all but inedibl and the calzone snack was like eating a brick. The plane again was ok generally but when the best thing on the entertainment is a repeat of the Repair Shop, no sport very few games, lots of Hitchcock films...17 hours becomes a very long time.

After we got back we received a survey from Qantas which I filled in appropriately finishing by saying ' if this is qantas' flagship service then Qantas management should hang their heads in shame!' not that they'll ever read it.

You can get better service and value for money from most major airlines and a couple of hours at Singapore or Doha can be very pleasant and lets you stretch your legs.

10,Worst experience,"My first trip to Australia and Qantas made it a nightmare. I understand that there might be delays due to maintainance and other things but atleast the airlines should take responsibility and compensate the customers. Because of the delay with Qantas arriving at Sydney airport( 1 hr 30 min delay), I couldn¡¯t catch my domestic flight to Brisbane and Qantas showed no sympathy nor compensated us. There service manager at the domestic terminal showed no respect whatsoever and shewed us away from the counter. Won¡¯t travel with Qantas again.

10,First and last time I will ever use them,"Whatever you do, do not EVER fly with Qantas. They lost my bag on the other side of the world and then let it sit in the airport for days (known by me due to an AirTag) but they did not even confirm my bag had arrived in the country, they didn¡¯t check it in online, they didn¡¯t tell me anything on the phone and told me I had to wait to be contacted. I couldn¡¯t contact the airport staff and left endless voicemails. My bag was due to be delivered to me the next day and three days later I had moved accommodation so it would never have been delivered as I had no way of changing the delivery address or contacting them. I went back to the airport at my own cost after having to buy more emergency supplies (given I was only due to be without it for a day) and it took 3 hours for them to give me my bag which was literally on the other side of a wall on a trolley. There were no staff at the airport or desks open. A manager treated me appallingly after begrudgingly coming down to see me (I was in tears with stress and frustration at this point). Eventually a lady walked past by chance and after around 45 minutes to an hour bought out my bag which had not even been put through customs.

I am now five months into a complaint following and when they finally realised they were to blame, not another airline - two they have tried to blame on multiple occasions (including one that I didn¡¯t even fly with), I¡¯ve received the same template email for the third time. It took them over two months to respond to one email and I am now looking to take legal action.

My second experience was an internal flight within Australia which was significantly delayed and we were not kept up to date and the compensation was 15 AUD to spend on a smoothie in the airport.

After confirming that the refund would only take a week to process I agreed. It's been 15 days, and I called back only to be told if it hasn't been processed in a week then it'll take up to 4 weeks. I mean if I had known that earlier I could've changed dates to find a more suitable time to fly back out where the difference wasn't so expensive. The guy helping me on the phone was literally a robot who just repeated the same thing over and over again and after me saying if I had know it would take 4 weeks I could have changed dates decided to go silent and then proceed to tell me the same thing again.

Again, it was a nice smooth flight without much turbulence.

I didn't mind deflating it but I was curious to know why as all other airlines allow them and they are sold in airports and I got the impression the cabin crew didn't know why either.

30,"Changed itinerary, late flight, tight connection, be we and our bags arrived!","We used QANTAS for a number of domestic flights during a recent visit to Australia from the United Kingdom. It started off being only two flights, from Sydney to Wagga Wagga on 10 February, and from Canberra to Darwin on 12 February. However, around 8 weeks prior to our departure, the non-stop flight from Canberra to Darwin was changed to an indirect flight from Canberra to Melbourne, with a very tight connection in Melbourne for the flight to Darwin. The flights were QF1529 (6.35pm departure, and 7.45pm arrival), with connection to QF838 (8.25pm departure, and 11.15pm arrival). Our departure from Canberra was late, and with a very long walk at Melbourne Airport to reach the gate for the connection to Darwin, time was tight and the flight had almost finished boarding when we reached the boarding gate. Thankfully we were able to board, and baggage was loaded and arrived safely in Darwin.

There¡¯s a couple of things worth noting:
1. At no point on any of our check-ins and boardings with QANTAS were we asked to show any form of identity. This is standard practice in many parts of the world, and certainly in the UK (where I live) and wider Europe.
2. There was free wifi on the flight to Darwin; it worked reasonably well.
3. There was no charging points at the seat on the Boeing 737 aircraft.
4. All passengers were served a hot meal; the cottage pie I was served was quite tasty; it was a pleasant surprise. We had expected to pay for food and beverages on this flight of nearly 4 hours.
5. The flight was fairly full, and overhead bin space was at a premium; no checks at the boarding area appeared to be made to monitor the size and volume of hand luggage passengers are carrying.

There¡¯s choices for domestic travel in Australia. We initially choose QANTAS because of the convenience of the flight from Canberra to Darwin. We did not fly QANTAS for our flight from Darwin to Brisbane.

10,No longer a great airline,"Having last flown with Qantas in 2007 we have avoided them since then as they were terrible then but as their new fares in Business Class were actually better in most cases than the opposition we decided to take the punt.
In all our previous 7 trips to the USA we have flown Air NZ business class or Virgin Business Class when they used to fly to the states.
It all started poorly for Qantas when our 10.30pm flight was delayed. We ended up leaving Brisbane after 1.30am.
Having paid a huge premium for our fares we expected that as Business Class travellers we would get what Qantas advertise and that is priority boarding. No such luck¡­.
Every passenger was shunted thru like cattle and business class passengers were put into the queue with economy and waited inline. So much for priority¡­
Once on board and in my cubicle I was in no mood to eat anything so asked the flight attendant to please make up my bed.
Went to the men¡¯s and when I came back the bed wasn¡¯t made but the FA told me I needed to complete the bed service myself. Seriously is this what Qantas call business class?
When we last flew Air NZ this service was carried out with a smile: was prompt and the bed itself was much more comfortable and larger than that provided by Qantas.
With our return flight imminent I can only hope that Qantas will finally take heed of the poor reviews and get their act together.
At this point they can only aspire to provide the same level of service that Air NZ do and having waited 16 years to fly with them after our return flight it is unlikely we would use them again.

10,Qantas lack of care & unprofessional to the point of embarrassing itself as a service.,"I'd now stand firm and totally not recommend flying with Qantas.
All 4 suitcases to the total family lost and getting any type of human that is not reading off a script is next to impossible.

So far 4 days without cases and no fresh clothes. More importantly no medical supplies. My wife suffered from various illnesses and meds for 48hrs put in hand luggage the rest in the suit case.

I can see my wife is struggling now as she has been with out medical for a few days.

We have just got exhausted trying to locate and get answers to our lost baggage.

I think the biggest issue here is the lack of support therefore lack of care from Qantas.

What was explained to us as a mild inconvenience of missing suitcases that would be returned the ne t day was a total "" LIE"" 4 days later you can't get an update.

Even customer services put the phone down on us when we simply asked when can someone take responsibility and deal with the issue.

Having flown to see Family regularly we have always flown Emirates. We saw the TV advert for Qantas over Christmas on tge TV in the UK.. so we gave them ago.

WHAT A BLOODY MISTAKE THAT WAS. ??

So right now I'm hand washing our family underware daily with a few basic items bought from Big W ( huge thanks to big W ) just so we can stay clean.

I can wholeheartedly NOT recommend ever flying with the unprofessional service that is Qantas", March 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

Cancelled the flight 3 weeked before by them we have to book another flight which delay again. Guess what gone for holiday for 9 days still did not get money back. Food was worse than dog food at home. The amount of food less that we give to the spirit on the road. Please don't call beef but called spirit of beef. Pick up our phone and make us waite for 13 mins still did not answer what we want to know. Hang up the phone with out us knowing. Worse airline in the world. Use air new zealand much much better.

50,Qantas Cabin Crew Kudos - Grady & Geraty,"I flew from Brisbane, Australia to Los Angeles to connect with AC flight home to YYZ on March 18 2023.
The long haul from Brisbane to LAX is 15 hours and unless you are seated in business, the flight in economy is barely tolerable. Contrary to expectations, as I booked a seat (not free) at the emergency row, the extra legroom made it comfortable and tolerable.

More importantly, I would like to give kudos to Grady whose friendly demeanor made me feel comfortable and at ease.

I was feeling somewhat stressed regarding the connection in LAX where I had to collect my baggage, check in again, etc. Grady searched out the details I needed to know and I followed his instructions and navigated my way through to the next terminal to catch my connection.
Additionally, another attendant named Geraty and Manager ( sorry I didn't catch his name) were so very lovely in alleviating my worries. These 3 lovely people represented Qantas in a manner that the corporation ought to be very proud of. I will fly with Qantas again when I am out this way.

I cannot say enough about how much they raised the bar in customer service standards. Thank you Grady, Geraty and Manager!

Massive line of people and there's only two flights. Then the total wait of bags was 5 kg over so I'm slapped with a $120 charge. After waiting forever to check in they won't even waive the fee.

10,Promises from overseas phone operators they are not delivering,"During the Covid pandemic, I was promised by Qantas to have my silver member status restored after I had booked a flight that was not registered to my details. However, this has not been done, and I am now a bronze member.

Recently, I requested a new Qantas money card, and I was told it was sent on February 22nd, 2023. However, as of today (March 23rd, 2023), I have not received it, and there has been no correspondence from Qantas about this matter.

When I contacted Qantas today, I spoke with a representative named Ray, who informed me that the card has not been sent due to a data issue and that a new card cannot be provided for another two months. I am scheduled to travel overseas in two weeks and need to access my money on this card, so this delay is highly inconvenient for me.

Despite my request to speak with a manager, Ray refused to transfer me and could not explain why the card has not been delivered or why I cannot access my money. He then transferred me to the Qantas travel money department, where I spoke with Sherline, who initially claimed the card had been delivered. However, when I explained the situation, she could not provide any further assistance and transferred me to another department, where the call was disconnected.

50,Exceptional Service,"I recently flew with Qantas from Brisbane to Perth with my elderly grandmother (86years). The service produced by the airhostesses has been nothing short of exceptional. They did their upmost to ensure she was comfortable for the entire duration of the flight even to the point They offered her some of their food as she wasn't impressed with the meal she was served. They then even made the effort to help her get to and from the bathroom.
We knew travelling with Nan was going to be a challenge due to her lack of mobility but the air hostesses went above and beyond for us and made the trip so much more enjoyable than we had first anticipated.

10,Worst airline in Australia,"Hands down the worst airline in Australia. Spirit of Australia? Only if Australia is the scum on the bottom of your shoe. The service experienced over 5 flights since the beginning of 2023 has been consistently the worst in the country. Not only is customer service at the check in counter horrendous, but the flight attendants themselves are also the rudest people you've met. On my Brisbane to Port Moresby flights earlier in Jan 2023, they had delays in check-in for over 2.5 hours! All because Qantas decided to reduce staff and switch to an automated check-in system that didn't work and relied on the 5 staff members around to run about helping EVERY customer. Then on my trip back from Nadi to Brisbane through Sydney, I could have easily made my connection but unfortunately I made the misjudgement of going with the ""seamless transit"" service instead of just taking the free airport bus shuttle. They told me I could not make my 2pm flight because the transit desk needed 1 WHOLE hour for domestic connections. So then they booked me onto the 4pm flight, which didn't depart until 5pm! So by the time I reached Brisbane, I was also stuck in peak hour traffic that further delayed my return home. In total, I was delayed by 5 hours with no apology or compensation for my time, only rude service.

Will not recommend to fly with Qantas to anyone well below average service & planes very poorly equipped compared to a competitor carrier e.g Air Nz (much smaller airline) asked for a blanket and was told we didnt load those on but clearly see upper class passengers being served them.

I called the Qantas number on two occasions and was not assisted to rectify this issue. No attempted to rectify the issue and make our travel a lot more comfortable. I have also been informed while on the calls mentioned above, Qantas does not provide airline prams/strollers for use between check-in and boarding the flight.

10,My flights were voided without my consent,"Absolute shambles. My round trip flights from Wellington to Los Angeles departing on 20th February were voided without my consent.
I received a text message on 19th February asking me to check in via the Qantas website. When I tried to do so on the webpage using my booking reference. However, it said that I needed to go to the airport to check in.
On Feburary 19th, I went to the Wellington airport. Two employees working for the contractor company that works for Qantas at the airport tried to provide me with my tickets. However, they were told by the ticketing department that my flights had been voided. The person in the ticketing department claimed the flight had been voided by American Airlines, their partner airline. On 1 December I was surprised to receive a partial refund of around 177NZD, a fraction of the approx. 1705 NZD I had paid for the flights. This made no sense as I had asked Qantas several times via email and over the phone to specify what the refund was for in November 2022 without receiving an answer from them. In November I had asked them to change my flight date and paid them to process this request. On February 19th, I was asked to call the Qantas hotline as the employees at the airport were unable to help me. To my disbelief the hotline staff told me that they would not reissue the tickets nor provide a full refund.
I absolutely do not recommend this airline. If you want to make any changes to your flight dates be prepared to spend hours on their hotline if you are flying internationally. I don't wish anyone to go through the saga I am going through with them. I am almost 2000NZD out of pocket because of the mistakes that have been made. I had to book another flight last minute, pay for an additional night at hotel, etc. This has been very stressful and expensive.

30,Expected better,"For a national airline, I expected a bit better from Qantas on my 6 hour flight from Sydney to Bali. The food service was ok, very small portion - not enough for a longer journey. The crew were friendly, and the cabin appearance and comfort was fine. However, the in-flight entertainment was AWFUL. Very limited options and hardly any films that are relatively recent, let alone new releases! At one point, I realised that many people, including myself, were watching the same film - Wakanda! During check-in, it's all self check in machines, and hardly any Qantas staff. You have to check in, print your own luggage tags, and take your bags for check in yourself - which I found to be quite cheap from the airline. Qantas also made the passengers on this flight to wear face masks. Why, I have no idea.

20,Dreadful airline,First time I flew with Quantas and having paid ?2400 return economy it was a disgrace. Having got my seat to depart which I was pleased with I was then asked to move as someone more needy needed my seat. On the plus side the staff were really nice and very willing to please. Onboard entertainment wasn't the best but definitely ok. Food was very poor both flights. Snacks not readily available unless you ask. On the return flight I had an email prior to departure advising flight was delayed. Then a further email advising flight delayed again. To their credit they did give me a $20 voucher to get food but that doesn't buy much for a delay of about three to four hours extra when you've already been their nearly three. Then to top it all the flight was delayed from Singapore to UK too which meant I missed my bus home and I couldn't get on another bus as they were full due to a train strike. So ended up waiting for 4 hours to get on a less busy bus. For the money I paid it was just chaos all round and I've since just returned back from Perth and used another airline who were fabulous and cost less than half what I paid for quantas.

10,Worst airline I've ever dealt with,"You'd be better off swimming to your destination than flying with qantas.

Where to begin.. this has been the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in my life.
My girlfriend and I flew from Melbourne to auckland, we landed but the winds picked up and they were unable to get our bags off the plane. We were specifically told to fill out a paper copy of the lost baggage form and hand this in at the airport, and that we would then receive correspondence about our bags being sent to us within 7 days at the latest.

It is now day 9 and we've heard absolutely nothing. My girlfriend and I have called every number possible, Sent emails, tweets, direct messages everything but still no one has helped us.

On the 20th I spoke with someone who put the phone down on me. On the 21st I spoke with someone who told me I'd get 2 calls back within the next 24 hours, 1 about our baggage and 1 about our compensation, i received neither. I called again today and spoke with 3 separate people today on the phone, each one unable to help. Their manager REFUSED to speak to me. I was then refused the name of the manager several times.

It appears no one in this company wants to help me, let alone is capable of helping me. I have been hung up on twice, I was even left on the line whilst a consultant left the phone on silent for 15 minutes hoping I would just hang up before she had to help.

In summary, I'd advise anyone looking to fly with qantas to reconsider. They snap up your money (and luggage in my case) and then refuse to help or answer any form of contact after.

We were put on to an alternative flight which took off over 4 hours after our original flight and included a 2 hour stopover.Apart from the inconvenience, If we had booked this flight originally it would have cost us much less than the non-stop Qantas flight we had paid for.
I enquired about the weather conditions with the other airline that supposedly caused Qantas to remove us from the flight. They stated that they were unaware of any adverse weather conditions that day.
I lodged a complaint with Qantas. who just replied with meaningless and irrelevant ¡°standard letters¡± which ruled out any real apology or offer of compensation.

I had a vodka with meal and it was the cheap stuff. I know, you could go up to the steward station and ask for beverages but on a17 hour flight surely the service could be more frequent. This was my 4th long distance flight in the last 14 months with different airlines and was the worst by a country mile.

And surprise surprise the flights had gone up by $3500 in a day, how convenient.

They we're so unhelpful I'm convinced they did all this on purpose and kept saying there was nothing they could do because it was a partner airline. So I would highly recommend you book directly with whatever partner airline your traveling internationally with because we always have issues with Qantas doing this, this was just the most intensely frustrating one.

By the way Qantas, we don't want another meaningless PR response from you about how sorry you are, we've been on the phone with several of your actual customer service operators and I can tell you, you don't care so just don't reply to this ok.", January 2023,Legroom: 10 Seat comfort: 10 In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
10,Never again!,"I have been trying for over a year to contact Qantas. They make it impossible. They will change your booking multiple times so that it no longer makes sense, even after you've arrived at the airport. And I couldn't even use my return portion of the ticket as they had the second leg of the journey leaving before the first -- and from a completely different city! In total I've spent over 30 hours on the phone waiting for someone to pick up. There's no customer care email address. I have written multiple complaints (and requests for refunds) via the complaints and refunds pages, but no one responds. It's a disaster. And to think they have received bailouts from the Australian government using (in part) MY taxes makes me furious. They have even been boasting about turning record profits!!! Yet they can't find the time (or pay sufficient staff) to attend to the valid concerns of their customers. All they care about is money. But this is nothing new with Qantas. When their competition (Ansett) went under just over 30 years ago they instantly tripled all their prices. And they maintain the same attitude today (because they know people don't have a choice but to fly with them or their subsidiary, especially with Virgin going under). The only difference between now and then is that the quality of their service has free-fallen. I went business class and ate half-cooked rice with some unidentifiable meat. We were offered only cheap wine and beer, with no pre-flight drink. Just like economy but the food was worse. My seat and tray were filthy, obviously hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and staff super rude, lazy and not at all attentive (took almost 2 hours to get their attention. They were all huddled in the galley, gossiping. In the end, I had to sit on the dirty seat for two hours, until the seatbelt sign was off, before I was able to walk up to the galley -- they completely ignored the call bell -- and request some wipes to clean it myself). All of this is 100% truth, no exaggerations. Maybe I was just incredibly unlucky, but it's hard to believe that considering the service was consistently bad the whole way through, from beginning to end. If travelling to Australia, go with an Asian airline. They always treat customers with respect; not like annoying nuisances (and I should add, at this point, that I was never unduly demanding and I always spoke to the staff politely and with maximum understanding). Worst of all, Qantas didn't provide accommodation as promised by the staff when they changed the connecting flight to the following day at the last minute, leaving me wandering through dark and isolated car parks after midnight trying to find airport accommodation. The flight attendant probably just told me that to fob me off; she told me to go to the service desk but she must have known it was closed outside of business hours (no one at the hotels was answering and most of the hotels were fully booked. I was not allowed to stay inside the airport as it closed overnight. Such disregard for passenger safety). Really, words cannot express how shocked I was at how far Qantas has plummeted.

The concern is how to bring back my power bank. Can I put this in my pocket ?", February 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
10,"Bag damaged 8 months ago, still not sorted out the replacement.","We had one of our bags badly damaged on a flight in June 2022 and contacted Qantas customer care. After a few emails and pictures they sent us an email in July 2022 staying the replacement bag has been ordered and we will receive it shortly. After 7 months and many emails to Qantas I have no replacement bag and not a single reply from them.
I called the booking line today and the lady there did a bit of digging and found out my case had been closed and she cannot look into it, she advised me to open a whole new case and reference my old case number.
So I started the process all over again, maybe it might get sorted before 2024.
Qantas is a joke and I hate having to fly with them now. We need more airlines to make them wake up and sort out their customer service, or lack of it.

30,Lunch time food service,"My husband & I took QF 735 From Sydney-Adelaide/1way cost $610 pp at 11:05am 4/2/2023 after arrived from a cruise ship. The flight was late. By the time they served lunch was about 12pm.
We were horrified lunch was just a piece of cake & coffee/drinks. For $610 pp. You would have thought a hot lunch or so....... Cutting cost by charging high fare but no decent food service... We think It is unexceptable and quite poorly.
We rarely travel economy unless we have to. Qantas needs to shake up the food dept. Reputation is very important if the CEO cares??

But we had to say the 3 gethlemen flight attendants, they were so polite, professional, attentive & outstanding service. They are our highlights 10/10 for them.

10,Flight Auckland to Bali,"We had a /Qantas credit about to expire so chose to go to Bali for 9 days. Our flight took us via Melbourne flying both legs on a 737.
Check in at Auckland was flawless and we boarded on time.
Qantas' choice to use a narrow body aircraft for a 4 hour flight to me seemed somewhat concerning. And it was justified, the seats are very close together with knees touching the seat in front.
The flight had about 12 empty seats allowing a lucky few to stretch out.
A bagged meal was passed out not long after seat belt signs went out. It was the same bag for all passengers and included a small bap with some relish and processed cheese wrapped in foil (my partner just got the relish). There was also a blister pack of small crackers with a chutney dip. a bloated packet of banana bread and bag of mini white chocolate cookies. The cookies were very sweet but I'm a sucker for white chocolate so I ate these. I've always been quite tolerant of airline food, it can't be easy to serve meals in flight conditions, but this was just disappointing. I tried everything to see if it tasted better than it looked...but it didn't. It all went back into the bag practically untouched.
The drinks trolley followed with tea, coffee, juice and water. If you fancied a wine or beer you were out of luck.
It was time to sit back, relax and watch something on the small screen. This must be an old aircraft as the screens appeared very dated. To make a selection required a bit of pressure as the guy behind me kept demonstrating with my headrest continually jolting forward. The selection was limited and it was difficult to find something to watch or listen to.
I decided to try and get as comfortable as possible on a hard seat with the recline function removed. Comfort was not an option.
The staff were very friendly and professional but it was a hard and long 4 hours.
We were crossing our fingers that the next leg would be an improvement.

It was but not by much.
The aircraft was practically identical. Cramped, hard seats, poor entertainment system, two toilets for around 160 passengers, no room to get up and stretch the legs....
The meal I selected was a beef rendang curry served in a small cardboard box followed by an ice block. They did serve alcohol on this flight.
Once again the staff were great, but 6 hours in those conditions was painful and I'm dreading the rapidly approaching day when we have to do the trip in reverse.
Generally I quite enjoy flying but I will never repeat this journey. Ever!

10,Horrible Horrible Horrible,"I booked with Fiji airlines who partnered with Quantas for the return portion of the trip.
Due to covid I was not allowed to enter Australia. To make a long story short, when I went to redeem that portion of the ticket I got the run around so bad to the point that they lied. I finally got through and demanded a refund they emailed me the refund information . I called and was told the refund would take a few hours which didn't make since so I called again and was told 3 to 5 business days then I was told 6 to 8 weeks. That was Dec 20th 2022 it is now Feb 12th and still no refund.....at this point they can take the 1250.00 USD and buy some class this airlines lacks.

Return flight despite them seeing me with my walker I was asked if I could walk up stairs to aircraft....NO.!
So arrive hame and collected bagggae then was sent all over the terminal to locate my walker only to find that the basket from the front was missing and when I asked about it the only response was""I dunno,it's not here"".Ok so put the walker up to leave terminal and it collapsed,it was broken and the front wheels kept collapsing.!
So off to baggage claims area where the lady behind counter said""hang on a minute"" which became 5,then took about 25 minutes to print 2 pages of instructions how to claim damages but only if it was a recent purchase and I had receipts.

10,Ms,"Qantas messed up my flight now several times. I needed to change my flight as I was issued the incorrect ticket (I booked a return ticket Brisbane to Delhi, leaving February returning May, and was issued a ticket from Brisbane to Colombo, Delhi to Brisbane instead).. The call centre staff over the phone had trouble understanding this and fixing it, even assuming I had made the mistake myself which is impossible for a return ticket, and also, I never looked at tickets to Colombo at all, it was just a stop over. And I spent hours on the phone sorting it out. The first person said she would reissue the ticket and nothing was done for days. I called back and there was no record of my previous request. Eventually I was given another ticket but it had an overnight stopover in Melbourne due to the ticket I had actually booked being no longer available. I requested to change again as I wasn't told this over the phone but was asked to pay. I change the flight for another day (after 2 1 hour phone calls) and was told it had been changed, was all booked. I didn't check immediately and just assumed it was fine but have found that the ticket has not been fixed, only half the ticket has been booked on the correct date and the previous ticket is still booked in! I have spent genuinely atleast 4 hours on the phone to Qantas and they are very slow to resolve problems.

10,Don't Waste Your Money!,"It's been a few years since we flew Business on a trip and previous flights had been a pleasant experience. Not so this Qantas one!
The first shock was the Qantas Lounge at Auckland. Decorated in drab, bowling club decor and uncomfortable chairs close together. There were children running around having a great time trying food. As for the food - it was a minimal effort. A soup, butter chicken and rice, salad/cold cuts, cheese and fruit and a couple of slices.
Then the flight, 737 800.
We compared Business Class with First Class on NSW's XPT train and the train came off best.
The train had more space and leg room. The food was about equal. Reheated individual serve meals (choice of two, train of five) of similar quality. Qantas served a dessert of a boxed long-life cupcake whereas the train had good quality icecream and similar cakes.
As for service we were offered a drink upon seating and a drink with the meal. When the meal was finished and the clean up, it was time for the attendants to have good gossip with off duty airline staff flying in business for the remainder of the flight.
They reappeared for landing.
Did we think the experience was worth the extra fare for Business Class?
Good heavens - no, no, no!!
Qantas has sunk to the absolute pits.
There is no effort exerted by anyone. They are just putting in the hours for the pay and no one, let alone management, knows or cares.

There was a drop down TV which, as I am small, I could not see. We were disgusted that there was such an old aircraft on one of the longest flights in Australia.The only saving grace was the delightful gentleman who looked after us.

10,Terrible,"Terrible service
I¡¯m travelling solo with 2 kids (2 and 4years old)
I have bought our tickets just for the fact that I was able to carry 2 extra baby items per kid (car seat and pram). On the booking reservation up until the payment it is specifically written I am allowed but now that I¡¯ve paid and checked my tickets it doesn¡¯t mention those items anymore.
EVERY single time I called to try to find out , I am told different things.
It¡¯s very concerning as when I¡¯m landing I have a car with no car seat !!!!!

No one seems to want to help or care

We use this pram regularly for my 15 month year old daughter and would have loved to use it couple more years really.
Arrived in Melbourne airport. got the pram damaged back ,bent connection to wheel.aka pram is not usable at all.
Women at the tullamarine airport documented all it and said Quantas have someone in frankston he could fix it. He said he can't cause he doesn t have the brand of my pram. Then every single week I made a customer call to Quantas about any information on what to do because I like a refund or solution really.
1. They could not find the case number the woman gave me from the airport. Then a new one was created. Saying someone will contact me back.never happend.
2. Week after I called back ..took ages to find out my new case number ..and then they realized this new case number was not assigned to an agent which is why nobody responded for a week . But now they will contact me within 24-48 hours they said with this new case number.
3. Nothing happend for a week.called back .after another 30 min on the phone it was found out that the wrong department was it referred to. And now they contacted customer service which is only reachable via chat from the department I called (??) Wtf..
Then they said they defo call me back but I will have to provide evidence or proof.
4. Nothing happend for a week again.
Getting an email today for my case saying they are not liable for any damages on baggage .

A true unacceptable way of dealing with customers. Fly away from Qantas they are not driven by guest satisfaction and inly trained to say that they understand although no action shows that they really do!

10,Quantas lounge,I am travelling from Perth to Johannesburg via Sydney. I have business class tickets. I got told at the quantas lounge at Perth that I will not be permitted to enter even though I have a business class ticket because I have flip flops on. Apparently I need closed shoes. Why was I not informed of this policy when making my booking? I've travelled extensively and have never experienced such a policy before. When travelling long distances or many legs on a trip being comfortable is a top priority and flip flops trump closed shoes any day. I will avoid Quantas in future as my ticket paid for that lounge visit that I was denied., January 2023,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

10,No Way To Plan With Qantas,"No Way To Plan With Qantas

I am very saddened by the quality of Qantas Airlines. I had my flight from Auckland (AKL) to Cochin(COK) via Sydney.
Lost my bags between Sydney and Banglore and had 7 hours delay for the return flight from Melbourne.

In-flight travel was clunky and rattling with an antique in-flight entertainment system that is barely functioning.
The aircraft was old and once again we are paying a premium price for a budget service. The QANTAS brand is no longer appealing.
Meals on Qantas is absolutely embarrassing, more likely to die from the plane food than an aviation crash.

10,Horrible service + flight cancelled + flight delayed,"Issue #1: I booked a direct return flight from Perth to Jakarta (4 hours flight). The flight was cancelled and changed into another flight with transit via Singapore.

So a simple 4 hour flight turned into a much longer flight while travelling with 1 infant and 1 kid. Our return flight now took 18 hours! No compensation was offered whatsoever!

Issue #2: The flight that departed from Perth to Singapore was delayed by 1-2 hours. This caused a very short amount of transit time in Singapore. Because of which our luggages were not able to be carried through to Jakarta, so we landed in Jakarta without luggage.

Issue #3: On the return ticket, the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Now our flight landed in Perth at 2:30AM instead of 12:30AM. Again this is very frustrating, especially when travelling with 2 small kids. Again no compensation was offered whatsoever.

I can't believe so many things went so wrong in 1 booking?!

50,QANTAS Flights a delight compared with their global peers....,"I know it is a national pastime to have a go at QANTAS at the moment but our trip to Japan and Hawaii, flying JAL, Hawaiian Airlines and QANTAS put it into perspective. Yes, our QF was 40 minutes late leaving Honolulu because of a broken toilet, and some of the charging facilities in our seats didn't work. But - they actually communicated what was happening, they made up the time, they communicated to people with potentially impacted connections and there were on ground service staff to deal with any outstanding questions. None of those were in place for Hawaiian Airlines. And atleast there were charging facilities in the seats. Not so JAL. Nor did JAL have the headrests that bend around your head to support you while sleeping. Only QANTAS offered a pillow and blanket to everyone onboard, regardless of what you had paid for your seat. QANTAS offered excellent food choices - the others either offered nothing or no choice at all - just slapped the hamburger patty on top of the reheated frozen three veg on the tray in front of you. QANTAS offered plant forward and two meat options. They provided dessert for every meal. Chocolate treats. Fresh salads. Warm garlic bread. Gin and tonics for each meal service. Craft beers, again regardless of your class of flight. Shortest wait for some time for baggage. Engaging and friendly staff.

This is probably a little unfair for JAL as we flew shorter trips and the point isn't to criticise them. The point is that QANTAS stood tall. They weren't perfect.

20,Disappointing,"We waited for over a year for our holiday which included a business class airfare to Singapore. As a first for us, we were very excited. Five minutes from the airport we got text saying delayed 2 hrs. We had arrived three hours early as told, so now a wait of 5 hours. But thinking we at least have the business class lounge all should be good. The lounge was packed with little options for seating. We ended up at the far left side of the lounge. The only food station (one only for all the passengers) was on the far right side of the lounge. Food available was three hot dishes (rice, butter chicken and soup). All luke warm. Cold offerings was lettuce leaves, cold slaw, quinoa and rice salads, all pretty bland and boring. Bread rolls with butter. No butter after two hours. Two cakes for sweets (Sara Lea carrot cake and can't start to describe the other but stale and hard). One coffee station. See attached photo's. Our plane was then delayed a further two times with boarding from 5.10pm actually being 10.20pm. The food offerings did not change during that 5.5hour wait.

10,Worst service I had in 15 years of travel,"Myself and a family of two young kids stuck in Singapore airport for two nights ... I have booked the direct flight through Qantas from Brisbane to Bangalore which has Malaysian Airlines connection between Singapore and Bangalore ..

It's all started here .... Our jouney from Sydney - Singapore has delayed by an hour and half.... Reached Singapore at 7.30pm on 1st of December 2022. Our connection flight from Singapore to Malaysia was at 7.30pm and the ground staff has advised it's been cancelled ... Around 10 families were gathered and ground staff were trying to solve the issue (Please note when I checked the email later I observed Malaysian airlines which is the cancelled connection as per quantas sent me an email about their delayed start at 8.30pm but I have not received any email regarding their cancellation of flight??.. So I doubt it's cancelled.)

[07/12/2022, 11:27 am] Rijesh KV: Ground staff spoke to us arranged flight for us .. Wrote in a paper next day's flight details.. I have asked them for tickets and booking .. They said its all booked and Sent us to hotel.. This was our first experience and we believed them.. and there was other people as well..
[07/12/2022, 11:34 am] Rijesh KV: The first day first half was great.. The accommodation was good, food was good.. We left after lunch to airport for the 22:55 flight. First thing we did was to call the customer care and confirming the flight details are right... After calling about an hour they have been connected and advised us the flights are good to go tonight.. I asked them about the tickets and there is no update in the Qantas app... They did not have any answer... Luckily I saw the Qatar airways counter check in and checked with them our flights at 22:55 (Please note our connection they have arranged at 22:55 was from Singapore to Doha and Doha to trivandum India through Qatar airways)... That's where I got the first shock... The flight already departed at 10:55 and the ground staff did an error informing it as 22:55.. I could not believe how the customer confirmed our flight an hour ago when I checked them...
[07/12/2022, 11:41 am] Rijesh KV: Hereafter I have got a clear picture of how bad the customer service and Qantas system for customer support... The major cause of this issue is they don't have a system in place when flights cancelled .. As a customer I did not get a ticket or even the app was not updated , so that I could not check for their mistakes... (Another weird thing happened is someone else in my hotel who became a good friend of mine later had a Singapore Bangkok flight booked.. That popped up in my app, theirs got automatically cancelled ... Later I understood actually ours should be cancelled , not theirs... Pathetic system.. Those guys even got our luggage when they requested luggage , luckily they knew us and let us knew)

The situation became bad and I was worried as the young kids of 4 & 9 are with me .. The customer care did not worry about the accommodation .. I kept on calling the customer service .. An hour to connect and tell the whole story.. After couple of hours they booked a flight (they said) and advised us they will send tickets.. I don't have to call them.. I lost my belief on them , called once more and confirmed booking ... They said they will send an email confirmation after tickets issued.. Asked about my accommodation, they advised they will pay 200 dollars for overnight stay... Singapore is a costly city, a 200 dollar accommodation will never be good also its a last time booking ... Anyway we did not have any choice... went there .. had our half sleep.. Early morning 4am checked for emails .. No tickets.. Called the customer care again... One hour of call to repeat the story.. It took another couple of hours to get the tickets sent to us...

Finally we went to airport after two nights staying in Singapore.. We were all exhausted.. Got srinlankan Airlines to Colombo then from there to Bangalore (India)... The root cause of the problem is their manual handling of these issues, not proper updating of the system... Hope no one will have these issues in future... After all these issues, our return flight from Bangalore has got auto cancelled and had to book again..", December 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

10,NO respect for Passengers,"Qantas cancelled my connecting flight from Vancouver to Sydney Australia while I was at the boarding gate at Heathrow (21st Dec), giving me no alternative but to get on their partner airlines (Air Canada) flight without knowing what would happen when I arrived at Vancouver.
At the Qantas desk, I and other passengers were told by the Qantas staff that we were rebooked on a flight on the 23rd Dec. then they handed us a ¡®disclaimer¡¯ sheet saying that as it¡¯s a weather related cancellation, they would NOT provide accommodation/food or transport. It was minus -9 and we were told ¡®claim off your insurance¡¯
We were able to find out online that there was an Air Canada (PARTNER AIRLINE) flight leaving later that night to Brisbane, so we asked if we could be put on that.
The Qantas supervisor was adamant that the airport was shut down and NO flights were leaving (incoming only) and had been like that for the previous few days! - again, if so, then why were we allowed to depart Heathrow & not placed on a different route to Sydney??
After several hours of strong discussion with the Qantas staff about the fact that there WAS a flight leaving Vancouver for Brisbane and requesting (and failing) that a more senior Qantas representative be present.
I asked for the supervisors name (Jane) and insisted that she get her superior on the phone. She said he wasn¡¯t picking up as he was on vacation!!
I asked her for his name and she said he was called Bill as I wanted the person (Bill) reports to, to come speak to us stranded passengers.
Eventually after SEVERAL hours and insistence that Jane keep trying to go up the Qantas chain of command until we speak to someone capable of resolving this issue (still no word from Bill) - miraculously, there was an Air Canada flight leaving that night for Brisbane and we all found seats on it!!
Turns out, that there were so many spare seats that people were lying across three seats able to sleep!
So WHY did Qantas put us passengers through this??

20,Disgusting Meal,"We have not Flown with Qantas for more than 25 years and were looking forward to the Flight . We were returning to Sydney after our Journey to Perth on the Indian Pacific . We had a few Dramas with the Booking with our first Booking being Cancelled by Qantas and then being Booked on a replacement Flight which was not convenient for us as it meant we had to be at the Airport around 6am . We chose a mor appropriate Flight and rang Qantas to secure this Flight . That was changed without too much fuss and then they tried to charge us Extra Money for changing the Flight . I reminded the Lady that it was Qantas that Cancelled the original Flight . She put us on Hold for about 30 seconds before coming back and informing us that the Fee would be Waived . We arrived about 2 and a half hours prior to our flight . Check in was by way of Machines . I could not get the thing to work so I contacted a nice gentleman in a Qantas Uniform and he took us to his Computer Terminal and checked us in there , we were then shown to the Bag Drop area to drop of our cases . We were now ready to go through security .
Security completed we went to find our Gate No 12 . As we waited and the time for our Departure was getting nearer , the Plane had not yet arrived at our Gate .
Approximately 10 minutes before our schedule departure time the plane arrived . An Airbus A330 / 200 . We have flown on one to Bali with Garuda . They have a 2 - 4 -2 Configuration in Economy . Our Seats were 55 J & K , Window & Aisle .
By the time we had Boarded and the Doors Closed we were 30 minutes behind Schedule . Taxying only took a couple of Minutes and we were soon on our way to Sydney . The Captain came on the speaker to announce that we had a good Tail Wind and the we should arrive in Sydney ahead of Schedule . Good Luck rather than Good Management .
Cabin Crew came around with Meal service , a choice of Chicken Salad or Slow Cooked Beef Ravioli . We both chose the Beef Ravioli . The Meal was served in a Cardboard Box with Wooden Knife & Fork which were absolutely useless . The Knife could not cut Pasta and the Fork just bent with the slightest pressure .The Ravioli was supposed to have a Tomato Sauce. This was non existent ., with not even a Trace of it . The Pasta was so Dry it was devoid of all Moisture and was the consistency of Cardboard . The filling could have been anything as it had NO flavor at all .I was hungry and tried to eat it however I gave up after 2 pieces . It was disgusting . The Cabin crew came around with drinks and we both had a Beer . After finishing our Beers we were asked if we would like another , which we did . The Cabin Crew were good , both Friendly and attentive . Soon we were descending into Sydney and were at the Gate by the Scheduled arrival time . There was a delay of about 20 minutes before our Bags were on the conveyor . The Flight was OK , The Cabin Crew were great . The Initial Booking was ok but Qantas managed to cause an upheaval which the did fix . I hate Self Check in . The Beer was Good The Food was Disgusting and Qantas need to do much Better than serving Food like this .", December 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,Sad how Qantas is dropping quality,"As my national carrier I am very saddened by how the quality of Qantas has dropped over the last few years. We visited UK for Xmas and booked Qantas, going over we were put on Emirates flights. The first issue was not being allowed in Emirates club despite being a Qantas club member. If you book an airline and they bump you to someone else you should be able to have the same paid for privileges! As it turned out the Emirates flight was great. lovely staff, comfy plane , very good food and snacks. Coming back we came Qantas on the long haul from London to Perth. What a difference to the Emirates experience! Uncomfortable cramped plane, food was barely edible, no little niceties and generally just felt like a budget airline experience. To top it all off a week later we are still waiting for one of our cases to arrive in Perth! Qantas used to be a very good airline but the last 5 years it has slowly gone down and down in its standards.

Then after 6 hours qantas said, no, the next QF flight would be the next day. Only some people managed to get on an Air New Zealand flight on the same day, but much later..
Then they just cancelled a flight we had to Perth. This time with 36 hours notice, and put on a much later flight rerouted around the country. That that messed up entirely the car hire and other arrangements we had put in place.

Almost every time (unless I fly business class) the middle aged ladies are discriminating against all passengers of Asian heritages. If you take a look at reviews or public forums you will see how many times it¡¯s been stated by past passengers.

It¡¯s always the same middle aged Caucasian Australian female flight attendants who are exactly the same. They get extremely frustrated if you speak or ask them for something. They might as well had asked me to get my own water and food. They always make me feel like I¡¯m wasting their time and not worthy of their presence.

10,Bought Extra Leg Room Seat (but not given the seat I paid for NOR refunded for it),"I underwent major knee surgery in Brisbane and specifically purchased a window seat with extra leg room for my return flight to Canberra. (I was in a straight leg knee brace and on double crutches.)

The seat I bought was a window seat (15A) but during the actual flight, I was seated at 3C (aisle seat). I informed the steward that I bought a window seat with extra leg room (due to the fact that I had anticipated that I will be in a straight leg knee brace and possibly in pain). He told me that there is not much he can do to change my seat.

To my further horror, after I was seated, a man arrived for seat 3A (window seat). So, I had to get up off my seat to let him through. This ordeal happened three more times during the flight as he went to the bathroom. Each of these movements increased by pain and by the end of the flight, I was very nauseated from the pain. I finally threw up outside the Canberra airport.

Since then, I have lodged numerous online claims with Qantas to have the extra leg room seat fare refunded. I have also rang them up to follow up on my online lodgements. These calls were constantly (and conveniently) dropped and when the staff have promised to ring me back, they never did.

So today (06 Jan 2023), I rang up again and Qantas has conveniently lost all my details (as such a long time has lapsed since the flight). This delay is caused by Qantas itself, as I have continually followed up on it.

To sum up, I paid for an extra leg room seat, didn't get it and was not refunded for it. This is deceit and fraud and I don't know where else this practice is acceptable.", August 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
20,Staff Member Forgets to Put Baggage Label on Suitcase Bound for Fiji,"We are long term Qantas Frequent Flyers and have been loyal to this airline for over 2 decades. Recently our loyalty has been tested with a couple of poor travel experiences with Qantas in late 2022, culminating with this latest trip. This includes a very poor experience with Qantas Travel Money.

Our recent travel experience occurred on 19.12.22 when we went to check in at Melbourne Airport as a family of 4 for our trip to Fiji via Sydney. On this occasion the staff member checking our in luggage omitted to place a baggage label on 1 of our suitcases and sent the suitcase down to the baggage handlers without any baggage label. We we travelling via Sydney and needed our luggage transferred to Fiji Airlines and therefore baggage labels were important.

This event occurred whilst I was dealing with the administrative matters for the family, being 4 passports, vaccination certificates, travel Insurance, and so forth, whilst the suitcases were being weighed and then sent down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. My husband politely pointed out to the staff member that they had just sent 1 of our suitcases down to the baggage handlers without any Qantas baggage label. Our daughters aged 20 and 18 had also noticed that the suitcase had disappeared down the 'chute' with no label.

There was then dispute when the staff member denied that the suitcase had been sent without any baggage label.

We hope that as a family that we were very polite to this staff member, however my husband and daughters were vey clear about the situation. Eventually the staff member acknowledged that they had sent 1 of our daughter's suitcase down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. This suitcase had all of our daughter's clothes in it for her holiday and also our family's gifts to be exchanged on Christmas Day.

If any readers of this review have watched the 2022 media reports in relation to how baggage handles with Qantas have treated baggage at Melbourne Airpor recently, and also Charlie Pickering's parody of baggage handlers on ""The Yearly"" on Channel 2's IVEW, you will understand that we did not expect to see this suitcase again prior to the conclusion of our holiday.

Our travel to and from Fiji, via Sydney on Qantas was very pleasant. My husband and I travelled business and our daughters travelled economy. It was our first trip as a family holiday since March 2020, when the pandemic commenced.

However during whole flight from Melbourne to Nadi I worried that our daughter's suitcase would not appear in Nandi, and would be left at Melbourne Airport for weeks. This would have had a detrimental impact on our daughter's enjoyment of our her long awaited holiday.

The luggage did turn up in Nandi. However for our bookings in 2023 and 2024 we are now looking at other airlines. It is our cumulative experience with Qantas in the latter part of 2022, that sadly Qantas is not offering the service that we once so enjoyed from Qantas.

The flight attendants sure take their time to get to you even when the entire plane is quiet and seatbelt signs are off. After all the money you pay, you¡¯d expect great service.

Not only is the actual flight experience bad, the moments leading up were worse. We booked a flight a flight in 2019, and because of Covid-19 it got cancelled. But not only was it cancelled, we did not receive a refund of the flight. We were told that the original flight money was kept as credit, and when we were given an opportunity to use the credit, prices for the exact flight doubled.

Cons: Dated planes with barely any leg room in the economy,

food was horrendous and both ways there was no choice other than a potato curry with rice.

Our flight was delayed by 90 mins in Bengaluru on the return leg after boarding, so the return leg became a 14 hr flight and we still got served 2 rabbit box takeaway potato curry.

Qantas for reasons only they know put me in the middle seat splitting a family of 4. I had 2 young kids and their mother on the left side and the father sitting on the right side of me. I asked the mother or father to move, so they could all sit together but both refused to sit with their own young children. Those 3 and 2 year old kids went absolutely nuts, high on pack of lollies. One of the kids emptied Orange juice all over me and their father sees it and says, ""they are just kids, that's OK"".

in-flight entertainment system is non-existent, so download Netflix movies.

10,Last flight with Qantas,"I have flown Qantas exactly twice before in 16 years of living in Australia. Both were domestic flights. The planes were old and service overall bearable. Virgin and Singapore Airlines have been my go to.

Recently Qantas introduced a long haul flight from Sydney to Bangalore non stop. It was attractive and decided to fly the route with my family.

I regretted the moment I stepped in the plane.

In no particular order

1. The toilets werent cleaned and was smelling of piss. No hint of any air freshener, no seat liners.

2. The meal trays weren't cleaned and there were significant sticky food stains from the previous flights

3. The seat pouch was full of dust and and residue from earlier flights .

4. Meal options were unavailable 1/3 of the way in to economy class. Only two options chicken curry and cauliflower curry. Chicken ran out 1/3 of the seats in. So had cauliflower curry. Horrendous mash of god knows what vegetable.

5. Second meal was chicken parm and cauliflower with rice. Two meals on the same flight with same ingredients. I tried the chicken parm, with sweet potato mash and tomato. Couldn't eat it as it was to soggy.

6. my screens and my daughters screen did not respond to touch unless u pushed through wirh all your might. I suspect the screen calibration was off.

7. The inflight meal announcement was made in one of the most funniest Indian accents I have heard. I have never flown in a flight that was so bizzare. Should be introduced to accent neutralisation training.

In all this the crew did the best they could. I appreciate their service.

The experience is more than the crew. I suspect this is the result of cost cutting and the pure pursuit of profit. Qantas knows there is demand and not many options.

Three of us paid approximately AUD 10k for return flights. We just reached Bangalore yesterday and now contemplating cancelling the return and booking the return leg on Singapore Airlines.

20,No Way To Plan With Qantas,"It seems that every time I have flown Qantas recently, they find a way to mess up the schedule, such that it is impossible to plan. We were booked on a 7:30 am flight from Sydney to Melbourne and as it was early, expected plane and crew would be available and departure might be on time. All were on board and fifteen minutes later we were still at the gate and were advised there was a mechanical issue that would take at least 90 minutes to fix, so we off-loaded and were allocated a new flight one hour and one and a half hour later (all done reasonably well). Mechanical issues happen but the plane had obviously flown earlier, or the prior day and you would have thought a mechanical issue would have been corrected overnight. Erratic schedule changes and cancellations and now mechanical issues adds a new level of uncertainty when flying Qantas.", December 2022,Legroom: 30 Seat comfort: 30 In-flight Entertainment: 10 Customer service: 10 Value for money: 10 Cleanliness: 30 Check-in and boarding: 40 Food and Beverage: 10
40,Flight experience saved by Paddy !,"We flew from Brisbane to Perth for a Christmas holiday - on flight 939 Dec 21st.
The flight itself was fine, but ... there were issues....
The food was nearing inedible -- not an expectation for the price paid for business class. You could have chipped a tooth on the pasta- dried out, little sauce, little flavor. (We should have had the ""economy class"" bangers and mash!). We have flown on many business class flight on other airlines - and Qantas food sits on the BOTTOM of the list ... come-on Qantas - get your act together !!
The level of cleanliness left much to be desired ... chunky dirt on the screen, and pen scribbles on the chair.
The choice of movies and programs was limited to ""B"" class fair.
The only saving grace was the service provided by the in-flight crew - especially the head steward - Irishman Patrick Ryan. He was excellent in every way!

10,Worst experience ever,"I honestly don¡¯t know where to start to describe how bad the experience was. The aircraft was in a desperate need of a refurbishment, one of my arm rests was broken and loose. The in flight entertainment is very old and functioning on and off - mostly off. The food is very basic and parts of the meal will be finished by the time the service reaches you and the staff will simply say ¡°we run out¡± and you just have to accept that. There is no WIFI - really not acceptable in this day and age. The plane was dirty with food scrums all over and the toilets were smelling of urine so bad I felt sick at some point.
Customer service is appalling throughout. The staff on board behave like they tolerate you at most. One of the flight attendants from Sydney to Singapore literally touched my face with her bottom twice during service and didn¡¯t even acknowledge it. They come with a bag to collect trash and if you are seated on the aisle seat expect to have the trash bag on your face when window and middle seat passengers are putting the trash in. I ended up picking their trays myself so I can avoid the trash bag touching my face. I have applied for an upgrade and it was rejected - I didn¡¯t see that as an issue initially although I have offered very close to the maximum amount. I asked again the ground staff at Sydney about the possibility of upgrading/changing the seat but I was cut off immediately with an ¡°absolutely not, the flight is full¡±. It was not full - there were many seats available in many areas of the plane and 2 people sitting close to me were upgraded to first class for free in Singapore. No transparency whatsoever (makes you wonder what is really the criteria for upgrades?!) and no attempt to offer basic customer service - I wasn¡¯t expected anything for free.

10,Horrible and Sneaky,"Last Dec 4th during COVID, I was not permitted to enter Australia. I was in Fiji and had to pay out of pocket for an immediate return flight, Which meant I had a credit. I've been in Australia now for 9 months and have to suddenly return to the states to assist a family member with terminal cancer. So I contacted Quantas they gave me a code for the credit and explained that all I need to do when preparing to purchase a ticket was to give them the code and pay the difference. Well the time has come for me to use this ticket so I called gave the code and was told that since I purchased from an agent I had to contact them....now Quantas had took over the ticket from Kayak. I contacted Kayak after spending a day trying to speak with a live representative who told me that Quantas owns the ticket.....after 6 calls and being told by Quantas I'm out of luck financially I reached a Quantas rep who dug deeper and with all my bitching took it upon herself to issue a refund which they processed immediately. Short end Quantas will do all they can not to honor a credit so keep pushing keep calling and do so during the week not the weekend you will speak to whomever wherever and they will hang up on you!!!!! Good luck. I forgot, so sin e they took ownership of the ticket I was held at ransom to pay their rate not the discounted rate I purchased very dirty move.....so do not ontact the airline if you purchased on line or with an agent they will take the ticket and charge you more. I was told by a representative that it's my fault for buying a discounted ticket I replied I'm in hospitality and understand fully that your company uses discounted ti kits to fill your planes as we fill our hotel rooms horrible service.....", March 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,POOR !!,"travelled over on Qatar and would give them 8 out of 10.... but would struggle to give Qantas 3 out of 10
The departures of all 3 flights were delayed. The service I received on the sector Sydney to Singapore was appalling. In flight staff in my area appeared to regard passengers as a nuisance and gave little/no customer service. I had a call button on for over 40 mins as my inflight entertainment wasn't functioning.... it was not answered so I attempted to gain the attention of a passing stewardess and she just put up her hand and ignored me!!! I reported the non functioning system but to no avail. It wasn't fixed whilst in Singapore so i had to travel the whole distance from Sydney to Singapore ( over 22 hours) without one.
Food was served 'McDonald's style' !!! .... no starters or deserts and with wooden ( absolutely dreadful) or plastic ( not much better) utensils and plastic containers for drinks. I asked for a cup of tea as did the person next to me... neither of us received one(Singapore to Londonnsector).
I should make it clear that Qatar presented meals 'old style' with proper meal trays.... starters and deserts...proper utensils and proper glasses.
Charging points in my and the seat next to me were also not working.
When I complained to Qantas they offered 2000 Frequent Flyer points as compensation ( worth next to nothing and a complete insult)

10,Who Cares-We Are Only Customers,"There is no joy in bashing Qantas, once a great airline and I doubt anyone at senior manager level in Qantas cares or reads reviews but they should as they might learn how bad the service is and in time they will see the outcome; most businesses who ignore customers fail in time. Despite emails from Alan Joyce claiming the love their customers and the extra points and other platitudes the service has not changed, a classic example of a flight from Melbourne to Sydney. It was scheduled for 7:30 pm and at 5:00 pm on the way to the airport in peak traffic the text came through the flight had been cancelled and we were booked on an earlier flight at 6:30 pm. Great news if we could get there on time, which we did. However the flight departed at 7:10 pm, because the crew arrived at 6:30 around he time of departure with no advice the flight was delayed. Qantas must know a day in advance that they need to cancel flights, or lower prices (now very high) to encourage more users but they leave it and hour and a half before they advice customers of he new flight plans. Imagine the complexity of getting people on different flights, arranging aircraft and crew and dispensing with those that expected to be flying; sounds to me like a giant mess and cost issue. You now cannot plan with Qantas who are totally unreliable but sadly my squillion points keep me with an unreliable and dysfunctional airline.

10,Qantas Customer Care similar to Ryanair?,"The sign of a good airline is how they handle disruptions. Unfortunately, on the 30th November Qantas had a disruption with their QF10 flight from London, and their shabby lack of communications, illustrated to me that in their pursuit of profitability they have forgotten their duty of care towards their passengers.

On the evening of the 29th November, I accessed my booking to ascertain the LHR departure terminal in order that I could book a taxi to the airport. To my surprise, there was a notice advising a 11 hr delay on this flight. Next morning, my booking again showed an 11 hr delay leaving LHR but surprisingly, it was showing the flight arriving on time into MEL with a 12h 05 total flight time! Although, during the day I received several emails from Qantas marketing asking me to purchase their merchandise, there was never any email nor SMS advice received from Qantas regarding this extended delay.

This situation continued until 1800 on the day of our departure, when I received a push notice from Qantas to say they had move my wife and I to the Emirates flight out of London. They also gave us our seat assignment, but when we checked in at LHR, Emirates told us these seats numbers didn't exist on their aircraft. As a result, we were unable to sit together all the way back to MEL.

I believe Qantas should have advised us and the other passengers of the flight delay, rather than leaving us to discover this for ourselves. Apart from the message advising us of the change to Emirates, there was no communications re this flight, received from Qantas.

All in all, after this experience I would rate Qantas as a third world airline with customer service standards similar to Ryanair in the UK.", November 2022,Legroom: 10 Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

The 12 weeks passed. No refund. We called in week 13 (each call takes 45 mins plus) and we're told it was imminent, but they were experiencing delays. Nothing came.

We called again at the start of Week 15. They said 'it's been processed right now'. You will receive an email confirming this shortly. We got the email confirming the full refund had been processed and would be in our account in 3-5 working days.

After the 5 working days passed, we have no refund. We called Qantas again. They said 'we've sent the money, it must be with you bank'. We called ANZ - they have never seen any evidence of a payment by Qantas. They provided proof of this.

We called Qantas again, with the ANZ proof. They can't help us, as their records show the refund has been processed, so ANZ must be 'mistaken'.

We know now that after 20 weeks; we're never seeing the money again. Qantas has literally stolen $1,200 from us, as well as making us waste hours on pointless phone calls.

Qantas is obviously a dying airline, and we know in a few years or so we'll get the satisfaction of seeing their corrupt / inept staff being made redundant in their hundreds. That'll help; as will our plan to lodge so many complaints, calls and other communications at Qantas that will we ensure they spend far more than $1200 dealing with us in the long run.

I rang Quantas customer services this morning, waiting 40 minutes for my call to be answered. I wanted to make sure that I didn¡¯t have to pick up my bags at Perth and check in to the new flight, as I was presuming it was a connecting flight since I¡¯d booked a flight to Melbourne. At first the agent confirmed that my bags would be checked straight through but then he saw the length of the stopover and said I would probably have to pick up my bags and check in to the new flight. I told him that I was travelling alone and would like a definitive answer. He couldn¡¯t give me that and saud I should check with security staff at Perth. I told him I wasn¡¯t happy with that and asked to speak to his supervisor. I was put on hold and then got a voice message saying that the offices were closed and ai needed to call back. 40 minutes of my life wasted and no further forward n

We were immediately told we would be missing our flight and would be re-booked onto another one. Despite having an hour to spare! The bag-drop / check-in team at the transfer looked to be deliberately dragging their feet to collect luggage to ensure that no-one could get on their 10.30am syd-melb flight, which was about half the flight from our quick roll-call. Instead of delaying the syd-mel 10.30am flight by a 10mins to get us on board, they rebooked everyone onto later flights, the earliest we heard from our fellow economy comrades was 5pm.

Qantas is no longer an airline friendly to its once stalwart frequent flyers. Long gone are the days of simple flight changes or - yes, I do remember these - free upgrades.

My comment was, ""your are just walking away, your not going to help me?"". The response was, ""yes,
Ring the call centre"". I proceeded to ring the call centre and after 26 mins waiting I was answered by an employee who sounded like they had just woken up, the audio quality was so poor, muffled and full of static that I could barely hear the the helpdesk agent on the other end.

I had to then ring again and wait another 15 mins to try and get further help.

So arrived at lounge in Sydney and the staff were happy to change the flight for me.

Domestic business class has simply deteriorated - no pre-flight drink and limited choice for breakfast.

Trans-Tasman business service has also taken a cost-cutting hit. No pre-flight hot towel, limited service options and limited drink choice. Crew did not follow up with any offers of 'top ups' of drinks, basically disappearing into the galley.

Had it being the Qantas Agent was professional and took the time to analyze the PNR she wouldn¡¯t have asked me to purchase these points and waste ?6,298.40
secondly, I tried to book another flight with Qantas but using the points which I paid for 6,298.40 would not get me a business class ticket to Singapore, where as if paying cash I would get a business class ticket from ?3,561 however using points they are not enough even though I paid ?6298.40, which means these points are not even worth the amount paid for.

It was an old Dash 8 that were first produced in 1984 by DeHavilland Canada and later by Boeing.On this flight the attendant was not that pleasant and overall, with slow luggae delivery it was not at all pleasant.

Firstly, there were multiple seats on the plane that were damaged to the point of not being able to be sat on to being duct taped together (I flew premium economy and there were 3 that in that class alone. Secondly, the service was atrocious. We were spoken to and treated as if we were a bother to flight attendants and were constantly told business class to presidente over our requests. The food was also inedible and flight staff took over an hour after service to clear to empty plates. Finally, I saw the economy seats were smaller than that of a budget airline, most people had to walk sideways down the isle because it was so narrow and they do not supply packs with eye masks and toothbrushes anymore for economy flyers.

10,Qantas very poor service these day .,"The aircraft staff are great , the new customer service and platinum so called service is terrible , after 23 years of flying with Qantas i am extremely disappointed as a Platinum member and life time gold i have supported qantas .

Purchased three business class tickets prior to covid close down my points are the following .

1 . I had to pay $2000 extra to use the first ticket which i understand prices have changed . I tried to change the ticket by 4 days and am told that will be $2080 is this fair ?.

2. I tried to book again and use the next credit ticket and was told its $5000 extra is this fair .

3. it was cheaper to book with 4 other airlines end up with Cathy pacific at $5700 total business class instead of $8500 with qantas .

4 . tried to book europe for next July premium economy the ticket is $6800 i booked with Emirates at $4500 and had the option of 3 other airlines at the same prices .

5. tried to use qantas points and its impossible to get flights .

6. Called platinum service regarding the Japan 4 day ticket change and the person on the phone didn't care just said if you want to pay i can change if not sorry i cant help you and wanted to charge me extra for a flight i was not changing that was $1200 the other $880 dollars was for the flight i wanted to change .

7. in general they dont care they dont honour the tickets they sold me , i was good enough to leave these in credit as i thought it would help them , but i was wrong .

23 years i will use my credits and fly with other companies and so will my 10 staff .

10,Avoid at all costs,"So I booked a 2 way ticket form Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane for a very short trip of 1 week. First my bag did not arrive on the same flight and it took 2 more days to receive it so no clothes and personal stuff for the first 2 days.
On return flight, checked in my luggage in Perth with no issue regarding the weight and size. Lots of issues on the flight from Brisbane to LA. First 1 sick crew member and a passenger that forced an emergency landing in New Caledonia which is understandable however very disorganized planning led to many terrible situations itemized below;
1- took 3 hours for medical team to check on sick passengers before evacuating them from the aircraft which could happen first thing without wasting time
2- Pilot announced a few crew members will pass the allowable limits of working hours if they want to continue to LA so we have to back to Brisbane after almost 8 hours. This means QANTAS is burning out the staff to the bone by giving back to back shifts where a 3 hour delay will cause an over limit working hours.
3- some other technical issues that we had to fly over Brisbane for another 4 hrs to get rid of the fuel for whatever reason that they did not tell us.
4- almost 15 hours wasted and we are back in Brisbane airport and had to wait 2 hrs in a line to get a hotel voucher. Terrible planning
5- booked on another flight and during check in, the staff refused one of my luggage saying it is over weight by 500 grams!!!! Made me to remove the stuff from my luggage with the fact that in the original check in in Perth, there was no issue with the weight and they have caused lots of stress and pain with their service and now 500gr is a deal breaker.
6- lost a day at work and the whole joy of my trip turned into nightmare just because QANTAS does not have a competitor and they can treat customers like this
7- I am Australian living in the US but will never consider a visit until another airline like Virgin Australian operates in this route.

I chose the beef brisket for lunch from a choice of two meals offered. Bread and a chocolate cup cake were also part of the meal service along with complimentary drinks. Snacks and other drinks were continually offered through out the flight.

No money has been refunded either. They will not let you speak to a supervisor no matter how much you beg. 28 calls later I am still getting nowhere.

10,PROBLM CHECKING IN,"my y wife and i, plus our kids had bookings from Auckland to manila on the 22nd September



We arrived at the airport by 4am, for a 6am flight, however when we arrived we were told there was an issue with payment on the tickets, and could not fly at that time.

I was advised to go home and call Qantas, which did several times, and kept getting cut off. The last person I spoke to said someone would call me back, which has never happened.


i explained I Hd confirmTION EMil nd eticjets, the status showed as confirmed, so how could there be an issue with payment?

If there was an issue with payment how were we able to get these?



Athe booking were made by a relative in the Philippines using an Amex card, and he has shown me his bank statement showing the payment to Qantas, so I am confused what the issue was.



On my last call to qantas, I was told we were marked as a no-show, which is 100% incorrect, and that comment was an insult to me. I ended up making new bookings for the 23rd of September, and we were able to fly. However I am now out of pocket by the costs of the new bookings(7000NZD0 and completely disappointed by the handling of this.", September 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,Customer Services badly in need of improvement,"I am notoriously early at the airport to have enough time for check-in, security etc. Now when getting my boarding card at the check-in, the card already shows that the flight departure for Melbourne (where I had to catch my connecting flight to Darwin) was significantly later, meaning I would not catch my connecting flight in Melbourne to Darwin. But the staff did not care about the fact that I had to catch a connecting flight and did not try to book me on another flight, althoug there were other flights from Perth to Melbourne on the same day that would have enabled me to catch the Darwin flight. Instead, I arrived late in Melbourne, the flight to Darwin was gone and I had to put up with rude staff of Qantas ""Help Desk"" at Melbourne airport who booked me into a crappy, run-down hotel on Tullamarine instead of the hotel right across the Melbourne terminal. And then, despite having booked business for the whole distance, they gave me an economy ticket for the flight to Sydney (from Sydney to Darwin was business class). Sorry, for that kind of money, the service quality and organization is really disappointing. And the staff on the airplane, well, they should get some training from Qatar or Singapore. Sorry, but simply forgetting to serve me my dinner is pathetic and needing a reminder is just atrocious. That airline needs to improve in so many ways. Sad, but true. And when you very politely point out that they created the problem, they get rude and aggressive.

30,"The Good, the Bad and the Terrible","Return trip back to Sydney on an older 737-800 out of Perth.
Good
- airport checkin, security and boarding all great - no hassle,
- left pretty much on time and arrived Safely - pretty much on schedule MOST IMPORTANT aspect.
- flight over for most smooth only minor trubulance
- seat comfort much better than on the flight over, which was on a newer plane.
- crew onboard were fine and no issues or concerns in this area.

Bad
- for a 4-5hr trans Australia trip this plane did not have any onboard entertainment, it does have Qantas entertainment on their app but doesn't help if you don't have a pad or suitable device (mobile at a pinch),
Can't understand why they would use this aircraft on these longer legs, should be confined to shorter<3hr legs better 1 1/2hrs. You can travel international in less time than across Australia.

Terrible
- food or the lack thereof - pretty full flight and I'm sure Qantas would have been aware of number of passengers on their plane but when it came to food service ran out of choice around row 22/23 and left passengers with only one option - pretty abysmal
- Got Worse - the two main meal offerings were a Chicken Salad or ""PORK"" sausages - could not fathom why on a two option meal selection Qantas would even consider making one of those choices PORK. Given the diverse customer base it was completely insensitive for Qantas to offer PORK option and this automatically negated any choice for persons of varying faiths or beliefs from any choice eg Halal or Kosher..
Qantas should seriously look at their menu offerings as it would have been just as easy to offer a Lamb or Beef option which would likely satisfy most (not all) customers needs.

Not being subject to Halal or Kosher requirements due to religious reasons but someone who does not in general eat Pork - it left only a couple of packs of Rice snacks and an apple as the dining option - this was not a Lone Wolf matter as the two elderly passengers adjacent also found themselves nibbling on rice crackers.
The chicken option would have been fine but as they ran out of choices - not an option.

The staff smiled, and the call bell worked, which were the only two things better than Aerosvit. No drinks were served upon boarding. Couldn't get a flight attendant's attention until an hour and a half into the flight (my seat and tray were filthy and I wanted some wipes so I could clean them). I used the call bell, and the light was on, but they were too busy chatting and simply ignored it. Meat stew -- at least, I think it was supposed to be meat -- was cold and unidentifiable with only partially cooked rice (not joking, I couldn't eat it and nor could the person across from me) and looked worse than anything I've ever been served with them on economy pre-pandemic. The economy food pre-pandemic was ten times better than this muck. I can't imagine that the economy passengers got anything worse, it's just not possible. Really small portion too, with just a tiny bit of fruit and a cracker with cheese. I was really hungry the whole flight. Only wine, beer or water options available. Was told accommodation was arranged for me due to the flight suddenly being split across two days (the flight had already been changed 6 times prior to that, with the return portion leaving from a different city and with the first leg leaving after the second) and surprise, surprise it wasn't. She told me to go to the Qantas desk after I arrived but it was closed. I think the flight attendant already knew that, but was just trying to fob me off because she didn't want to have to deal with organising anything. Wasn't allowed to stay in airport as it closed so had to traipse around in the dark at close to midnight trying to find something. Felt totally unsafe. Cheapest option I could find at such late notice was AU$225(!) because everything else was fully booked. The list goes on. Even the business lounge was serving old fruit salad (the fruit was brown and I didn't trust it) and cold, stale pizza that looked like it had been sitting there a loooong time. Meanwhile Qantas is boasting about how well they are doing financially and paying celebrities to take part in expensive ads. Have been trying to get a reimbursement for the accommodation for over half a year now. Nowhere to upload the form, can't speak to anyone. You literally get put on hold for around 4 hours only to get cut off when the 'transfer' you to another department. Qantas, you are alienating every single loyal customer you ever had. At least those flying domestically. I've heard so many horror stories. I'm not exaggerating or making up anything here. These things all happened.

40,First flight since 2019,"I know Qantas have been taking a bit of a bashing recently but my experience flying business class from the Gold Coast to Sydney in late May 2022 was as good as ever and a great first flight after not flying for about 30 months due to Covid.

Checking in took no time at all but was a little disappointed that even though I was on the one ticket from the Gold Coast to Sydney to Tokyo to London with Qantas and JAL I wasn¡¯t able to check my luggage in all the way to London as even though my layover in Sydney was about 15 hours as it was overnight they just said no.

The lounge at the Gold Coast airport was about as crowded as I have ever seen it but I managed to get a seat and whiled away the 90 minutes or so before boarding. The food and drinks on offer are fine given that most people using the lounge are only taking a relatively short flight.

Boarding was orderly and at the Gold Coast airport they usually use both the front and rear doors to board. I guess they are still in Covid mode as no predeparture drinks were offered.

The crew were friendly and given the flight is blocked at 1 hour 20 minutes and you are probably in the air for an hour they do a great job serving a full hot meal and bar service and the food was great. The seat was the standard 737 business class seat and is fine for the flight to Sydney.

The only downside was that my luggage even though it had priority tags on it seemed to take ages to arrive but that wasn¡¯t the end of the world.

10,Left Stranded,"Absolutely appalling 'service' provided.
Booked a 'round the world' ticket - BNE to LAX, ATLA to LRH & LRH to BNE.
Due to some unforeseen circumstances I had to call them to find out if I cancelled the last flight, what credit/refund amount I would be given.
Called and spoke to someone who was clearly working from home (dog barking in the background), asked them what cost I would get back, he told me $3,700 - I told him this was incorrect as that was the cost of my 3 flights and I had utilised 2 of them already. Upon asking him to check again, he said the same price. No way was this correct so I told him to leave my booking as it was - NOT to cancel my flight and I would call back later. 10 mins later, I check my booking and it no longer exists! Called straight back and was advised he had cancelled my flight - asked to be put straight back on it, no luck, it was now fully booked!
After several phone calls with different agents, the following morning someone told me they had put me back on the flight (after being told multiple times it was not possible) - but I was now back on the flight, booking had reappeared and my seat selection etc all there.

Fast forward a week, 24hrs before take off, try to check in online. Can't. It's already 10pm so I figure I will call in the morning. I call in the morning, advised that I am on the flight, I just need to check in at the airport. Asked the agent to re-confirm this. She said, yes all fine. But didn't sound sure. I asked her to check the manifest and make sure I am on the flight, 100% - after being on hold, told no, I am not on the flight! My only option was a $855 refund. Note, flights to BNE from LRH were now $3,000 each way!
Asked to urgently speak to a supervisor as I am meant to be flying that evening. Advised they only had one and she was on another call, could they call me back? Bare in mind, I had been told before I would be called back and the call never came. So I remained on hold, 2hours later finally speak to a supervisor. She advised I could now only get a refund of $823. Told her this was not acceptable and she needed to figure out a way to get me home or refund me enough to get home. She told me she needed to look into it and would call me back in 1hr.
Over an hour later, she calls me back with 2 options, the $823 refund or I can get the next available flight, almost 2 weeks later(!) but it would cost ME $2,000!
Told her no, Qantas pay for my new flight home or refund me an appropriate amount to get me home. She advised she couldn't authorise this and that someone from higher management would call me at 9pm that evening to speak to me. Again, bare in mind I am supposed to be flying home at that time!
Conceded that I wasn't going to get any help until someone from management called me back, I agreed to this. She said in the meantime to fill in a customer service form online and someone would be in touch that way too.
Did anyone call me? What do you think...?
I filled the form in on the 20th Sep, still no one has come back to me. Emailed them yesterday (13th Oct) stating someone needed to call me back by the end of the day. Did they? Again, what do you think...?
Beyond frustrated and left stranded, I booked my own flight home via the cheapest option.

Still NOTHING from them - out of pocket thousands of dollars because THEY CANCELLED MY FLIGHT WITHOUT PERMISSION!

Disgusted doesn't even cover it.

I will put this review EVERYWHERE until it prompts someone to call me back and arrange a refund of the cost of my new flight, the (ridiculous) amount they said they could refund me and the cost to make the international calls.

That might not seem a lot to some people, but I have been flying with Qantas since 1980s ¨C domestic and international ¨C both a Frequent Flyer and Qantas Club member ¨C for a massive number of flights (over 1000). Last time we flew Qantas overseas (2018) it was a bit of an issue ¨C and the problems we had were never answered. Since then we flew Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. Due to Covid, I had a heap of Qantas points saved up from credit card purchases since 2018 so I used them all up for our first overseas flights. I sincerely regret that and will never make that mistake again. The problem is customer service ¨C not the pilots, planes or schedules. I had an airport logistics issue that needed addressing (yes it is serious) and the local airport has been very helpful, but to get it completely sorted I had to talk to Qantas. All weekend I tried ¨C web and phone ¨C no one was able to help ¨C because it was the weekend was main excuse. IMO their whole customer service 'front end interface' is about getting callers to use the website (and piss off). I tried again this morning (Monday) and after waiting nearly 15 minutes on the QC/FF number, I was given a recorded message from a non-english speaking person (probably overseas call centre) ¨C ""we are upgrading our system, please call back after few hours"" ¨C they then terminated my call. So I rang the specific 'Qantas Customer Care' number and after being on hold for 21 minutes I explained my problem. I was told that I had to call 'Qantas Agency Direct'. I tried the number they gave me and it didn't work, so I found the number online, and they will only speak to registered IATA members (Booking Agents). So I rang back the Qantas Customer Care number again and after being on hold for 27 minutes I advised the problem, and after waiting another 10 minutes the operator solved the problem for me (I hope). When the call ended I was asked to rate the call ¨C the ratings I gave were about the operator and I gave the highest rating. But I bet the general manager of 'customer service' uses those ratings to say their service is good for his/her bonuses ¨C but it is total crap ¨C I was just lucky to get a good operator. Qantas = best pilots, best planes, best maintenance ¨C WORST customer service.

10,Kafkaesque experience trying to book a flight with Qantas,"I attempted to book round trip from Vancouver to Perth online on the Qantas website, paying for it partly with a credit I had from a Qantas flight cancelled because of Covid and the remainder with my credit card. I selected flights and filled in my particulars, but despite references on the website to an option to apply such a credit to my payment that would appear on the payment panel, the only option presented was to pay with a credit card. I called Qantas to try to determine how to apply the credit.
After five phone calls spanning several hours I finally got on to someone who ""thought"" they could do it by taking my booking over the phone...but in the meantime the price had gone up by $700. After another hour on hold while they ""considered"" giving me the first fare, they came back and said I'd have to pay the higher one.
At that point I gave up, booked a flight for close to the first fare quoted from Air Canada, and applied for a refund of the credit from Qantas. Another hour on the phone to do that. My sense is that the staff manning the phone lines at Qantas are undertrained and that the company has no interest in catering to customers who have even slightly complicated queries.
I fly between Canada and Australia often---usually on Cathay, Singapore Air or Air Canada. My few experiences with Qantas have been the worst by far---I recommend avoiding the wherever possible.", October 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

10,Shocking Customer Service,"I travelled to the UK back in June, every flight was delayed on my return meaning I missed my qantas flight from Sydney back to Brisbane. At the airport I was organised a hotel room at the Novatel and a dinner and breakfast voucher to use for dinner. I arrived at 8:30pm to Sydney the transfer took an hour to come and pick us up. When I was dropped at the hotel I was told room service had stopped so couldn't use the dinner voucher and my flight was leaving before breakfast started, so I had to order outside of the voucher for dinner and breakfast. I put in a request to get these refunded on July 11th, the customer care team came back mid August requesting my bank details, I responded straight away, haven't heard from them since have followed up numerous times, and received no refund. I have tried emailing, calling with my reference number no responds and i have been hung up on, there is no live chat or any other way to contact them. Absolutely shocking.

10,Mr,"All problem previously expected and still happened.
Bought international flight brisbane - Sydney - Santiago - Rio, 3 months before my departure date. I was sure that i would have problem taking 2 bags, specially brisbane - sydney.
To avoid that i was making sure i buy the tickets from qantas website, not from other tird part websites, and on the process i was making sure that i had 2 luggages included or if i had to buy it, that wouldn't be a problem, cause i definitely was taking 2. No evidence about it was showing anywhere, first think weird.
Between i buy the ticket and actually flight, i asume that qantas changed the 2 bags that you are aloud to take to only 1 bag, so I end up at the airport with 2 luggages paying 300$ for the extra bag.
Also was asked for vaccination certificate, but is not everybody that is asked for it. But i had it, so that was not a problem.

Upon arriving to Perth I went to lost baggage service and they had confirmed they had left the item back in Karratha. They put it on the next flight and will contact us when it arrives and will deliver to the address where we are staying.

My Wife recieved a call that evening but had missed the call and they left a message the item arrived and can be delivered but there was no number left to call back on.

Following day I called Qantas 1300 number and it went to a call centre Overseas. Explained to them what happened and gave them the lost property reference number only to be told they are still looking for the lost baggage and will call and arrange delivery when found.

I told the service guy that it's not correct that it's still lost and has arrived at Perth airport ready to be delivered.

I had to tell the person twice and each time was put on hold for 30mins while he tried make contact with Qantas Lost baggage counter at Perth Airport.

I asked if the item can be delivered by 10am that day or if not where can I pick the item up.

After nearly on hold for 1hour and 30mins I gave up.

Later that day I was near the Perth airport and dropped into the lost baggage service counter and there was 2 attendees and one customer.

We had never received a call all day to return our lost baggage and when asked why we can't call the lost baggae counter direct they said they take the phones off when busy.

Luckily the item was there but we weren't happy with the crap service that Qantas Lost Baggage had provided.

20,Still a long way to go and very expensive,"This was the return leg of my 6 week business trip to the USA and prior to Covid i would be commuting to the USA 4+ times a year on Qantas via Dallas. The trip over is a separate review and the worse behaviour by an airline i have ever experienced.
Qantas are currently flying the B787 Dreamliner on Syd/Dallas/Syd as they haven't got all their A380's back yet. The ticket prices were unbelievably expensive being the most expensive by 50% that i've ever paid and nearly double using Delta earlier in the year. In fact it was close to business class on AA a few years ago. The plane appeared to be mainly business people which is understandable given the ticket cost. It was i think probably 95% full. Shock #1 came when i checked in at Cincinnati when i was charged for an additional bag. I had noticed previously on the ticket it said 1 bag but the Qantas web site clearly said 3 bags for flights USA to Australia for Qantas Club. American Airlines check in rang Qantas to no avail with the guy saying they are having lots of issues with the Qantas baggage limits. Now i suspect this is because they have the B787 but it's dishonest to say 3 bags on the web site. Flight boarding was quite efficient at Dallas , the plane seemed quite clean and tidy. Meal time came along , 3 choices - Chicken Caesar salad, Beef Stew and a plant based dish. By the time they got to my seat all the Chicken had gone, i could hear others like myself grab the stew which they were fast running out of. I pity the folks that only had a choice of the plant based dish, doubt Qantas will do anything about it but lift your game on the meal choices in economy. Entertainment on board good choices. I am not sure how comfortable the seat cushion actually is. Was very happy to see my bags in Sydney.
Am seriously considering other options for my next business trip to the USA which is sad because i tried to fly Australian to keep Australians in jobs.

So, booked our flights: BNE-MEL-LST-HBT-BNE in August.

We then began notifying family, and making plans for visits enroute. BIG MISTAKE!!!

Within 7 days, the itinerary changes from Webjet began. We'd receive automated messages via them that QF was asking us to approve itinerary changes or request a flight change.

Our flight of choice was removed, but no other reasonable choice was offered, short of a stopover flight.

This has now happened to us 8 times in the past month, and we are still a month away from our trip. The original itinerary looks nothing like the dogs breakfast we now have to swallow.

The direct flights have all turned into stop overs, and our travel time has basically doubled. We were flying jets on almost every sector, most are now turbo props.

This is a joke QF! The flying kangaroo has become the sculking field mouse, jumping from town to town.

If this is what domestic travel has become I'll stick to road, thanks.

Once on the plane, it got better. We had exit seats so plenty of space and a free seat in the middle. The plane has good entertainment and we enjoyed a movie. The food was delicious and plentiful - wine was served and we got a Lindt chocolate for dessert.

Even though we left late, we arrived on time. But then the fun started. The pilot and ground crew seemed to be in an argument about the airbridge. They even described it as a ""stand off"".

The customer service we received from all Qantas staff was excellent at all times. Staff were friendly, nothing was a problem.
One stand out example, was that we changed a flight at very short notice due to an emergency at home (it was a flexible fare - totally worth the $).
The representative we dealt with was understanding, patient, fast & took all of the stress out of the process.
Every flight we had with Qantas was head and shoulders above any of the other flights. The crews were lovely, funny & went above and beyond to make sure everyone was comfortable.

While I sympathize with the problems of staff shortages and resulting flight changes, what I can¡¯t come to terms with is the fact that where a flight does change, our selected seats are then automatically changed. To make matters worse when we try to select new seats we receive a message saying seat selection is not available for this new flight, just an aisle or window preference.

10,Has anyone been able to claim the Qantas $50 flight promotion?,"Having received an email from Qantas, with a U-tube video from Alan Joyce, offering a $50 gift on any return flight I downloaded the app and obtained my promo code. I then proceeded to book an international flight only to find there was nowhere to enter the promo code when making the booking. A few days later I received an email from Qantas Frequent Flyer advising me of my ""unique single use $50 flight promo code"". The email stated the ""promo code could be used to make a single itinerary Qantas operated return booking on qantas.com by 30 November 2022, for travel by 30 June 2023."" I therefore went to the Qantas website and made a booking and entered my promo code. However, after completing the payment I found the $50 gift was not applied. I phoned Customer Support. A very affable person said she would correct this and phone me back in 2 hours. I confirmed she had my correct phone number. I did not receive the promised call!
At best it appears Qantas is making it as hard as possible to claim this gift. At worst this is just a deception to get people to make a booking but not receive the promised $50 discount.

We also paid for exit row seats on the return flight and, when we asked Qantas to waive the charge (in line with the free upgrade that others got on the way across) this was denied.

30,Qantas has improved but not quite there yet...,"Any Australians that have flown for more than say 10 or 20 years both domestically and internationally will no doubt have some fixed ideas about Qantas. I have seen their ups and downs. Years ago they weren't the best (to put it politely) for their in flight service especially on domestic travel (which I would have to accept would sometimes not be a happy experience for them). I can say that they have picked up a lot in recent times, however some of their staff seem very junior these days and lack a little knowledge of how things actually work. One junior stewardess said to me when I was about to leave the aircraft on arrival at Sydney Airport ""You'll be out soon"" to which I said that would be a miracle once you arrive in Australia (the baggage claim took almost an hour from memory). The older staff however are very courteous and pleasant. As for the food, Qantas is exceptional - for economy class you get a great meal, the vegetarian option being ""world class"" (as they would say in Bris Vegas about Bris Vegas). The Australian wines are excellent pairings. Qantas however is lacking quite considerably in the in flight entertainment. First of all, there is no music. Many airlines do provide music, and there are many passengers like me who love to browse through the music selection and who would prefer to do that than watch a movie. Tell Qantas ""The Day the Music Died"" was not just the title of Don McLean's great song, but a Qantas policy for their in flight entertainment!!! Qantas is to be complimented for including classic movies, but on the other hand, whoever wrote the brief reviews for the movies has no idea about classic cinema (it's as if the reviews were written by a ten year old). For example, there were several Jimmy Stewart movies in the classic cinema section where Jimmy Stewart was not even mentioned by name as a main actor in the actual film you might select. That is akin to regarding Sir Don Bradman as an incidental player in the Bodyline series or believing that Pele was a average Brazilian football player. Qantas, while you may not regard this as important, dumbing down classic cinema is not showing your world class aspect.
Importantly, having no music at all on your international flights is a great tragedy for a long haul flight. Passengers please don't forget to bring a good book if you are not into movies.

20,Sadly disappointed especially at such a huge price,"28th August.
I wasn¡¯t happy at all with the service on this flight. Compared to Qatar Airways or Emirates I think they need to pick their game up. I paid over ?9000.00 for this!!! I was in front section business class . Boarding at noon we had one main meal and a breakfast . Snacks only available in between over a period of 16.5 hours
In my cabin it took ages to bring the different lunch courses and my main, lamb dinner, when it eventually arrived from the other section was tough and not very hot. I had a glass of Riesling, with dinner, but when they came for top ups, girl said they had runout and she would get from other cabin. I never had it.
Eventually again I grabbed another unsuspecting staff member who brought me it. Pudding, they explained was not what we had ordered from menu. However we could have a rice pudding instead!!! How on earth could this happen. There are only 42 BC Seats!!!
After waiting to see if coffee would be served I gave up and requested a cup of decaffeinated coffee. Again long wait. When it arrived Not hot and Not decaffeinated. After this debacle the coffee trolley trundled in. But if you didn¡¯t have the strength of character to ask for chocolates, or liqueurs ,you would not have been offered them. More like British Rail Tea Trolley service.
Lunch service was finally over by 4.45pm I asked for a cup of tea a couple of hours later. Twenty five minutes passed, it still had bot arrived , so I grabbed the first staff member I saw,, who said she would get it
. Ten minutes passed, then it arrived. Not hot. Breakfast was pre ordered I had the pancakes with decaf coffee and mango . The coffee was so bitter and Not decaffeinated I requested a cup of tea. That was exactly what I got A cup, no saucer, of tea¡­.. The food was served on plastic trays , no white linen tray cover or any finesse with your individual salt and peppers, etc as standard on other BC services nothing really that said I have paid a lot of money for this, but it¡¯s worth it.

10,Disgraceful customer service,"We Have been using the Qantas website To make changes to our international flights. We were attempting to change on flight and tej website kept saying generic error so we called customer service ¡­ big mistake !

Firstly it takes about 60 minutes to get on somebody on the phone. Then it took another 60 minutes to try and change our booking because the operator did not really have a good grasp of the English language. She was attempting to book us on flights from origin cities we were not close to. It was quite stressful. By the end of the call we thought she may have had our flights correct but we wanted the itinerary sent to us via email to double check. Upon receiving the itinerary it is clear she¡¯s messed it up. We were attempting to fly from Rome to Sydney via Perth. She only booked us a flight to Perth which is five hours flight away from Sydney. So for the last three days we¡¯ve been calling the call centre waiting 30 to 40 minutes speaking to somebody else who barely understands the English language we would speak to them and they will put us on hold and then the phone call disconnect this happened two or three times. We finally got someone and gave them your phone number and said call us back if Nicole disconnects and when she went to put us on the Sydney to Perth flight which we were supposed to be on she wants to charge us an extra $1500. We said at the time we tried to book that last week we were actually due a $340 refund. She couldn¡¯t quite grasp the concept of why we did not want to pay. We asked for a manager and she would not supply managers details we asked for a contact in Australia and they would not do that. The best we could get out of them was they will look at the call logs and booking logs over the last few days which suggests they do not believe us. So we have to put our plans again in limbo almost a week until we hear back from them and I¡¯m not confident they will fix it. I can also add that there is no email for Qantas so you can¡¯t contact them that way and the website which we were booking through now doesn¡¯t allow us to make online changes happen we must call this call centre number.

Nope...Qantas don't give a crap about helping because one of the flights is operated by another carrier...and after speaking with the other carrier they said they can't do anything because it's a qantas booking.

What a bloody joke. This is what being an Australian company is is it? Extorting as much money out of people as possible for something that costs literally nothing to resolve...and in fact is costing a whole lot of money in lost time and staff billable hours trying to get someone to help instead of just fixing it.

I'll keep ringing up till the cost of hours spent on this in wages is as much as the damn flight if I have to.

I received a text message at 9 AM the day of my international flight, saying my flight had been delayed until the following day! I contacted the travel agent who contacted Qantas customer service who told her the flight had not been cancelled nor changed, she told them about the text and asked to speak to a supervisor and they hung up on her. She called back and spoke to someone who said they could not accommodate another flight to get me to LAX to get my connecting flight(Business Class )to Costa Rica. She had a look at other flights and found a flight with Jetstar Via Hawaii which would work. She asked them to cancel the ticket for the following day and she would book the Economy Jetstar flight, their response was we would have to pay a cancellation fee! We had no choice at this stage so we paid the cancellation fee even though it was their flight that through everything out! I missed my connecting flight at LAX due to Jetstar Flight being delayed by 4 hours and eventually got a refund minus a large chunk of cancellation fee which I never got back....what a mess.", July 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

Just did a return frip from Syd to Perth and the flight over was perhaps the worst flight I've ever been on...and that includes flights Ive taken to New York, Dubai, London and many much longer trips.

Both flights the AC was spewing bone-dry 40degree air the entire time. Requests to turn the temp down were ignored.

Both flights we sat on the tarmac for an hour after boarding, and it was so clearly obvious that they waited until we were all strapped in captive to tell us there was delays, when they have been having them non-stop lately.

Both flights had our seats moved without notification. The return leg had 4 seat re-allocations! Same thing happened back in May. Never mind that we were travelling with an infant child both trips, or that the seating was specifically chosen around our needs.

Both flights were cancelled and shifted/consolidated to other flights less than 24hours prior to original flight time with literally no notice other than us seeing the different details when chicking in online. No emails, no SMS headsup. No calls.

This failure to notify cost us not 1, but 2 prepaid and non-refundable shuttle buses on each end of the trip.

Even the flight attendants were in the dark on some of the flight consolidations. I overheard cabin crew chatting, saying they were completely blindsided by management with no alert that the flight changes until the minute they were on the plane.

10,NIGHTMARE OF AN EXPERIENCE,"Travelers, do NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!

I booked a flight from Papeete to Los Angeles that was originally planned for September 2021.
Due to Covid Lockdown, I had to cancel that flight last September, and was issued a credit voucher.
In January 2022, I tried to use my flight credit to book a new flight from Papeete to Los Angeles, leaving on August 19.
After over 12 hours spent on the phone trying to get ahold of a customer representative (since using the flight credit to rebook is not an option online...), I finally spoke to an agent on February 9 who confirmed that my credit could be used to book flight QF3817, since fares were the same.

I received a TRAVEL ITINERARY confirming the booking.

On August 19, when we were in Papeete ready to check in at the airport, the airport staff told us that our baby did not have a valid ticket and asked me to call Qantas.
I did so for over an hour. The customer representative told me that NONE of us had valid tickets and that I needed to buy tickets again, when the flight was about to leave 90 minutes later.
This is a HUGE mistake from Qantas as I had already received confirmation this flight was booked for us.
I had NO CHOICE but to do what she asked since we were stuck at the airport with a 1 year old baby and 3 year old boy. I told her she was wrong and that I already had the confirmed itinerary.
She charged over $2000 to my credit card for a flight we had already booked! She would not listen to me at all, and was not trying to understand a mistake from Qantas had been done.

This is unacceptable. The experience with Qantas has been a DISASTER for months, filled with tears and stress.
I was in tears on the phone when desperately trying to get to speak to someone to use my flight credit and getting disconnected after waiting for 5 hours.
I was again in tears at the airport when you took me hostage by forcing me to re-buy tickets to board that plane.

I am asking to get this charge refunded, since it was unlawfully applied.

I am a gold member and have been travelling with Qantas for many years. This was my first flight since COVID restrictions were softened. I had planned to travel on the A380 knowing it was highly likely I could get a business class upgrade as when I went to purchase a business class seat their were still many available. 24 hours before my flight Qantas changed the plane and positioned my next to the toilet on a 787. There was nothing dreamliner about it. I was sleeping when the dinner service came around and when asked if I could get a snack/dinner the hostess its too late and told me to wait for the Ham and cheese sandwich in an hour. After waiting for 2 hours I ask for it and the gave me a cardboard box with a soggy sandwich. I asked for a soft drink and the response was go to my seat and we will give it too you. Then when waiting for my luggage it was one of the last out even though I was a priority traveller. The whole travel experience on Qantas was the worse I have had with Qantas.

We travelled London wgtn return and the service was very average on all six flights. Is it a case of staffing levels I am not sure. the seat and entertainment were good. But with the exception of one leg, staff we basically absent in the cabin. From Syd to Sinapore, an eight hour leg I saw staff only 3 times. Toliets were dirty after an hour in the aircraft. Any request that did not follow their routine was not possible. Food was okay, but snacks ran out pretty fast. Cheap cheap cheap

Sydney qantas lounge only had one food station open and with a very restricted set of food. The Singapore louge on the other hand remains awesome

Maybe unrelated to Qantas, but the Intl transfer at Syd was insane. It took over 60 minutes due to so many people going through one security line. Apparently this is normal.

To top things off our luggage was lost in london on the way home. Way to go.

20,Always Late,"To get from Perth to Hobart took three flights. All good, it is what it is. However Qantas is now worse than during the COVID restrictions. Not one of the 6 flights of this round trip departed on time.

The delays caused in no small due to airline polices introduced by senior management and with cabin crew bearing the result. We bored and for 45mins a number of passengers blocked the isle fumbling, tring to find a place to put their bags! Crew asked if bags could be brought forward for checking in and insted this fumbling continued.

Cabin crew is the ONLY resason they did not get a one. I looked out the window after taking my seat to see ground handlers throwing luggage at two different airports, Melbourne being the worst. Inflight meal boxes (Breakfast hot) not good.
for the price I expect better.

The terminals for Qantas are another bain. Melborne is a Unpleasant if not horid experience. Adelaide, walk down the othe end of the terminal and visit Virgin, friendly and welcoming seating and eating. Perth terminal was equally unimpressive.

From the top to lower management - you need to lift your game as I will choose Virgin any day over either Qantas or Jetstar ANYDAY. Example would be to make check in on all hard cabin luggage when flight fully booked, (reducing loading/turn around times)

But no one answers the phone, calls regularly drop or the attendant hangs up on you. Multiple times were given NEW credit reference numbers that could only be used if we rang back.

Finallllllly booked overpriced flights using our credits and paying the difference, SHOWED UP ON BANK STATEMENTS, and then got a call at 7pm THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR FLIGHT saying the booking was pending because we hadnt paid. I was driving so couldnt retrieve my bank statements and attendant wanted $5,000 on the spot. She promised to call me back in 15 minutes when I was at my computer. NO CALL. Spent the entire night on hold, calls dropped, hung up on. Eventually just drove to the airport and spoke to first Qantas humans we could. They were hardly any more helpful or sympathetic. Said we never paid for our flights, refused to consider my bank statements. Charged us the price of the flights THAT day, rather than the price we booked at.

Once we were answered unfortunately we were dealing with someone whom was obviously inexperienced and/or poorly trained and/or incompetent. They also struggled to understand my Austalian/English accent and I suspect had never been on plane in their life as they demonstrated no grasp of our situation. As a life time gold frequent flyer I was pretty sure what I was requesting to be done could be done but in each case there go to answer was ""we will need to cancel your ticket and reissue it"". Which I could accept except each time that meant putting new airfares onto my credit card whilst waiting 12 weeks for prior one to be refunded. We ended up with over $40k airfares on our card! What is worse, even after all of that it was still not right! I eventually managed to find the number of the Australian Call Centre in Hobart. As i suspected, our issue could be dealt with and furthermore it was completely resolved in 16 minutes. These are not exaggerations: 16 minutes to remedy from Australian call centre vs 16 hours to make matters worse in offshore call centre.

The QANTAS brand is being destroyed by whomever made the decision to send their call centre offshore.

10,Quantas refused to help us after making us wait in a line for hours. The most ridiculous airlines I've ever seen,"After arriving at the Sydney domestic airport, we needed to check in our baggage and fly back to Brisbane. After hours of waiting in line, the Qantas staff simply said we'd missed our flight and gave us a set of numbers to call Vietnam Airlines for help. It's absolutely absurd because Vietnam Airlines was on time and Qantas simply cast the blame and refused to hold themselves accountable. They even said we should have raised our hands to tell them we were late at the beginning, which makes no sense considering the first thing we did before joining the line was told their staff we were going to be late but it was them that told us to join other passengers in line and that's the main reason we missed our flight. The worst part is that they refused to re-book our tickets for another flight and failed to acknowledge their fault. It doesn't matter if you have spacious legroom, comfortable seats, or good food, they all fail before good service. How would you expect customers to experience all that when you can't even get your customers on the flight?

30,QF 600/QF2366/QF1795/QF637,"In recent times I flew to Rockhampton with QANTAS. My forward journey actually went really quite well...as always the catering is exceptional on QANTAS flights. Staff on both forward journeys were professional and as you would expect.

On the return journey, I asked if I could change my last flight because I would be in Brisbane all day ( and it was cold and overcast) ... the staff at check in could not help, suggested I call a number and then said if I booked with a third party, then nothing could be done unless I called them. This bit perplexed me as they already had my money, I was not requesting a refund and I was prepared to pay more if necessary. Not upset with the staff, confused by processes at this point.

The early flight out of Rockhampton ran late, but we were advised of this. Of the four flights I am rather sure it was this third one ( although it may have been the second) where they left it late serving drinks and almost didn't make it through the small plane... but that is just a misjudgement of time.

The fourth flight was the messy one. I arrived back early from being in Brisbane City to be advised it was late. About an hour late. I can't change that, neither can the staff nor the airlines. There might be safety issues.

But the flight continued to be later and later and no advice was given. The boarding time on my phone and the boards at the gate remained the same and we boarded 20-30 minutes after that. This is where it got a bit sloppy. And that last flight it felt like we had a school ma'am running it... she could very well have been a military officer in the War, but not on our side... I have never been on a Qantas flight where the staff were anything like this. This flight may have ran late... which again, would have been outside their immediate control... but being advised is appropriate and considerate. As for the staff... maybe they bought their military leader out of retirement... I understand they are short on staff.

All in all the first three flights were as expected to Qantas' level of service... and it was indeed a pleasure to fly with them.

Over a number of flights taken in recent months, the baggage check in machines in Melbourne have many that did not work and if they do they failed to print a baggage tag. If they cannot get a baggage machine to work, how about aircraft maintenance. Every flight taken has been late from half an hour to more than an hour, all one might expect could have been avoided with better management. One flight they changed the flight number without advice and this caused confusion at the arrival end. A damaged bag on one flight still has not been resolved after six weeks have lapsed. The flight to Perth had the most revolting example of airline food I have ever seen. It was inedible cardborad box of scrambled egg, sausage and a bean and tomato mix in which floated something that claimed to be a hash brown.Total waste of time and better not to serve and save the money.

10,Where do I even start DO NOT BOOK THIS COMPANY OR JETSTAR!!! You will live to regret it!,"I have so much to say about this experience and it starts with Jetstar as well as a cancellation that was made by Jetstar/Qantas. I originally made the reservation through hopper. The first leg of the flight was Jetstar the second leg of the flight was through Qantas. When I received a notification for my flight being cancelled it was from Qantas even though it was a Jetstar flight. At first I didn¡¯t think anything of it because they are sister companies. Then I tried to call them, they told me that they couldn¡¯t help me with my reservation because it was through Jetstar, they gave me the number to call for Jetstar. Then I called Jetstar, they said they couldn¡¯t help me because it¡¯s Qantas that cancelled it and that I booked through a booking agency. The booking agency had no information about anything but had to contact them to get it. Mind you this is all less than a week away from my trip. Then when we figured out the flight that needed to be rebooked Qantas/Jetstar lagged so badly that I couldn¡¯t even confirm online and get my boarding pass because of how close to my departure it was. Then I get to the airport and the flight was delayed by an hour and a half. Then they moved me from the seat that was at the upper area of the plane to the back with me being one of only a few who had an international connection. I had requested a vegan gluten free meal option they gave me banana bread that was made with egg and wheat and lunch was butter chicken. I was so hungry I ended up eating the rice that was in the lunch. The jet star plane was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY! We might have all been given Sano wipes and made to wear masks (which I¡¯m fine with it when it makes sense) but those things don¡¯t help when you¡¯re in a filthy plane that has air circulating through vents that aren¡¯t cleaned! The vents were caked in black dust, the seat backs had splatter marks from something that extended to the ceiling, the seat backs were full of trash, the floor had food crumbs and other debris (see photos), the wings of the plane were covered in duct tape (see photos). Once we landed there were no staff to help direct people who had never been to the Australian Sydney airport and no signs anywhere to direct you to the correct area for connection. My flight landed as the connection was supposed to be boarding. When I finally got to the gate they couldn¡¯t find my return flight. We had to jump through hoops to finally find it. When I got on the Qantas flight it looked nice and I thought things were finally looking up for me. They had blankets and headphones and the seats appeared comfortable and roomy. I had requested a window seat, they gave me an aisle one but no big deal it was a shorter flight, at least it wasn¡¯t a middle seat. The man seated in front of me laid his seat all the way back and was practically in my lap. So I went to put my seat back to get some distance and be more comfortable, turns out my seat was broken and couldn¡¯t be fixed. They didn¡¯t offer to move me or help in any way. I decided it wasn¡¯t worth fighting about and returned to my seat only to find that my head phones were broken. They replaced those. I went to go and put on a movie and the selection had a maximum of around 10 or so things as did the TV option. Luckily my neighbor /seat mate was friendly and we all got to talking so we made the best of things. Of course meal time came and they were serving all meat options and when I asked about my vegan meal they said I needed to order that ahead of time I told them I did and they shrugged it off. Then I arrived in Bali, excited to embark on my journey to a beautiful place and go on my much needed yoga retreat, I stood there waiting my my luggage ¡­ you guessed it¡­ it never came. I went to the lost and found as per what you are supposed to do when an airline can¡¯t get their crap together and is clearly incapable of competence throughout the entire organization. They had me write down my details claiming they were unable to locate my bag location based on the tag I gave them (you know the one they give you for bag claim that they generate ) and gave me 40.00 worth of rupiah with a consolation ¡°goodie bag¡± with an oversized tshirt and pants that are the latest in prison fashion (I don¡¯t care about this it was mostly funny at this point) a long with some helpful toiletries which was nice but no replacement for the things that I packed and needed for this trip in order to participate in this retreat. Nonetheless I kept the faith that they would find my bag based on the information I wrote down for the woman at the desk. The next day, no luggage. I got curious about who I could contact and then I found the online portal that gave me the online option to check my bag¡¯s status. Boy am I glad I found that (which btw nobody explained to me that this existed) . The woman who entered in my information COMPLETELY FAILED at entering everything I gave her. It was as though they just made up what kind of bag I had and they let a toddler enter my information. They put in that it was a dakine bag that was soft and had a pull out handle while also putting in that it was a hard case. They never gave me the option to put in the kind of closing it had so they made that up too. I fixed the details of the bag and added in what was inside the bag to see if it would help. The computer won¡¯t allow me to change the suitcase material option to hard case but still has the option selected that is in a different area that says hard case so hopefully they will figure that out but I¡¯m not hopeful. I wondered why I hadn¡¯t gotten a status update this morning so I went back in and saw the Orion to check you contact information¡­ OH MY GOD ! They had my name wrong, my home address wrong, my email wrong, my phone numbers country code wrong, it said I wasn¡¯t contactable (no kidding with all of that wrong information) they had all of my hotel details wrong they also said ¡°deliver to this address¡± for my home address even though they told Me it would be delivered to my hotel when it arrived. I updated all of the information in the system but have very little hope that my bag will ever be found and once someone sees everything that is in there I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if it gets stolen. I am stuck in Bali with no clothes, no camera lens that is my profession, and no ability to reach anyone. I will never, as long as I live, EVER fly Qantas or Jetstar ever ever everrrrrrr again! If you care about your sanity, do NOT fly this airline ever! They should shut this company down! I started with a 2 star rating because the flight attendants at the counter were nice and helped me even though when I was trying explain things they kept cutting me off and preventing me from explaining why the reservation was so messed up. I have since updated it to show 1 on account of the baggage issues and situation involved with that. If I could give negative stars I would. I work in the medical profession as well and let me say this, if I was as bad at my job as these people are at theirs, lives would be lost and I wouldn¡¯t have a job anymore. Do better humans.

10,Last minute flight changes. Lost baggage for 11 days. Terrible service. Poor communication.,"Hello! My name is JK from Christchurch, New Zealand. My tickets were all booked through Qantas Airlines. I had a flight from Christchurch to Sydney on June 9th takeoff 0600 and landing 0745, then Sydney to Los Angeles takeoff 1015 and landing 0700 on June 9th, then lastly Los Angeles to New York takeoff 0900 and landing 1747. Around 2115 on June 8th, I received a text message from Qantas that they had to change my flight/flight would be delayed for Sydney to LA (QF11) and an update will be available in 30 minutes. I waited but there was none. They knew that I had a connecting flight (QF3107) from LA to New York, which I would miss if I were to go through the delayed flight. I had to call Qantas Contact Support hours before my flight to find me flights that I would of course not miss. It was an almost 4-hour call and I thought the agent was so patient that she sorted everything out. Initially it was QF11 Sydney to LA take off 1015 on June 9th, but was changed to FJ910 Sydney to Nadi take off 1315 on June 9th as flight QF11 was already non-existent. It was an unforgettable experience for me because my birthday was coming up in June 11th and I did not want to celebrate it at the airport alone. I was really stressed out and tearful. I felt a little relieved that one of the airport managers in Syndey was so kind to assist and reassure me that everything will be arranged. But even then everything was not really fixed. The airline could have at least offered a flight upgrade.

I was able to catch FJ910 and made it all the way to JFK Airport in New York City. Upon arriving I was informed by my last carrier Delta Airlines DL436 that my checked baggage was not with them. 

I filled out a Delayed Baggage Form with Delta Airlines.

After multiple follow-ups from Qantas, Delta, and Fiji Airways, I was able to finally receive my luggage on June 20th. The exterior of my luggage had scratches. It was such a hassle and a traumatic experience, not having my checked luggage for 11 days, since I had to buy new stuff even though they were in my luggage. I also had 3 luxury bags inside which added to my anxiety about my luggage.

From rebooking my flights twice to the delays of my checked baggage, Qantas had made several egregious mistakes that was very difficult for me. The airline may have reasons, but it was very hard because some days there were no communication or clear answers. I have not received cash support like other airlines do or anything in acknowledgment of the hassle and bad experience.

I believe I deserve a fair compensation for all of these. I hope this would never happen again on your future flights¡­

Unfortunately, it did happen again. Upon coming back to New Zealand on July 10th, my checked baggage was again missing. I did all the necessary steps at the airport before leaving. In the end, I received my luggage after 3 days, on July 13th.

What a horrible experience! I have documentation of my experiences, a sad reminder of what I went through. I hope Qantas reaches out and try to win back a customer.", June 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,Qantas used to be a great airline - service is now second class,"Since the pandemic Qantas has proved itself to be a second rate airline. We now avoid when possible. First the 4-6 hour waits on the phone to redeem credits- ours was such that there were no online options to do this. This was a 3 month long process.

Flight from Sydney to Honolulu was in an old aircraft with no entertainment and was scruffy and rundown- it felt like the 90s. Encountered some turbulence- not much but the seat belt signal went on. Although three children just in our area were sick and filled up bags and a guy next to us had an epileptic fit , there was no way to get an attendant to come help . All calls were ignored. One man stood up to help his vomiting child and a voice come over the loud speaker asking him to sit down. It seems the safety of staff is more important than the passengers. The passengers ended up helping each other.

Then on the way home Qantas cancelled a flight and rebooked us. For some reason the ground staff weren¡¯t notified of the changes so another 45 min delay on the phone. Hard to understand how that happens with computer systems.

10,Qantas needs to lift their game,"What a disappointment from Qantas. Their Business Class service was a joke, it cost a fortune and was more like Premium Economy with a bed provided.

Once the plane took off I was offered a drink and requested some nuts to go with the drink. I received a small plate with 8 almonds and asked if they had any mixed nuts but was told that is all they serve. The same glass was used for my dinner wine and just topped up. When I woke up that glass was still sitting there on my side table as breakfast was being served. My breakfast never arrived because they had forgotten to pick up my order form the night before. There was not much time before landing and the steward was apologetic but I was limited to my choice of coffee and croissant. When I went to the galley to ask for a bottle of water I was asked to bring my empty bottle back to them and they would fill it. They don¡¯t replace the bottles. How nice it would of been if they could of offered to get the bottle for me and refill it. Their amenities bag contents have shrunk to midget size and I wonder if the PJ¡¯s will be the next to go. Instead of giving the boss a huge pay rise I think the time has come for Qantas to start taking better care of their passengers who are now paying big dollars to fly in style.

Qantas have again cancelled our tickets with no reason or accountability, and we have no comeback. Contact with them involves hours waiting for a call to be answered before being hung up on, with no calls ever returned and no-one taking responsibility. I understand this is a deliberate approach by Qantas as it has happened to so many others, and I can only assume that cancelling our tickets is also deliberate as we have used little cash to make our bookings and are therefore of little consequence.

10,Thieves - Flight Credit Scam,"DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS

Qantas issued me a 'flight credit' as a refund for a flight I had to cancel (I paid extra to book a ticket that permitted a refund). In theory, I am meant to be able to use this flight credit (approx $400) to purchase another Qantas flight (12 month expiry). However, they have made it literally impossible for me to actually use the flight credit. On 6 separate occasions, I have called the designated phone line and spent in total over 17 hours on hold. Each and every time I've reached someone they have said one of the following:
1) We can't process this now please call back later
2) I need to liaise with another department please call back later
3) There are no flights available (even though I provide them with an exact flight number for a flight that has seats available to be booked on their website).
4) Twice they have simply hung up after waiting for over 4 hours on hold each time
5) On my final effort, I called and they said I had a $400 flight credit. They then said I couldn't book the flight I wanted and hung up. I called back and got onto another person. They said they checked my account and I had no flight credits and that they went back to the original booking and the terms and conditions did not permit a refund. They refused any further discussion and hung up.
Clearly, they are not only making it impossible to use the flight credit, but also resorting to deception and flat-out denying that I have a flight credit. They are effectively holding my money for ransom and are not providing the service.

No empathy. Told us that we should just deal with it as it was in their terms and conditions when we bought the tickets.

When we asked about refund, she told us it would take 68 WEEKS for it to be processed! We got quite upset, she then put us on hold then HANG UP. We called again, again we were put on hold, then hang up. This seems to be their strategy.

After calling around to make arrangement for our work, we accepted that we would have to stay another day in Hobart. Then I noticed we have no upcoming trip booked on Qantas app. We rushed to Hobart, was served by Qantas staff at the counter (Ting) who was equally rude. Basically could not care less about what happened to us. Again no apology. No sympathy. All she wanted to know was if I would accept the first flight she rescheduled for us.

10,"Terrible food, no pillow, a shortage of water PLUS the flight was delayed for almost an hour (which wasn¡¯t a good start)","I have tried to get feedback from QANTAS with regards to my experience on QF0063 on June 21st. I have flown with QANTAS on many occasions and have always had nothing but good things to say BUT this last flight was an absolute shocker.

Not only was the food disgusting but the whole business class smelled of fishy fish from the ¡°Thai fish cakes¡± that were obviously heated up in the galley. The lamb that followed was served on soggy bread and was a messy pile of lamb. I personally found neither dish edible and was actually physically sick by only tasting the lamb dish, I spat out the first bite of the fish cake it was so foul tasting. My experience was such that I was left with no appetite for anything served on the rest of the flight.

There was one small bottle of water at my seat (5K) when I sat down when I asked for another bottle I was told they didn¡¯t have but could top up my bottle - in my view this is not acceptable and unhygienic.

The biggest issue for me was that as a FULL paying business class customer they did not even have a pillow for me!! I was actually flabbergasted when they offered me a sleep mattress as a substitute - NO PILLOW?? No apology, no pillow ???¡â?

I waited several days for a response from customer complainants and when it came it was a sorry the food wasn¡¯t to my liking - nothing about the lack of water NOR the fact that they didn¡¯t have a pillow for me. Absolutely disgraceful.

I am a pensioner and saved up to have a comfortable hassle free flight unfortunately this was anything but.

I also had to queue for over TWO hours to get through security!!

I lodged a claim in Brisbane at the Baggage Services desk (something contradictory about that ""services"" bit). The poor gentleman was clearly tired from dealing with frustrated clients and indicated he was so embarrassed to be a Qantas employee he no longer wears his shirt in public. He provided me a reference number and said they sent me a SMS message advising me of the fact the bag was not loaded onto the plane. I quickly checked and confirmed to him that no SMS message was received. This was Day 1. Day 2, no advice, contact Qantas and advised there were ""lengthy delays"" if I wanted to wait - or track online - I chose the later to establish my bag was scheduled to arrive that evening into Brisbane - not morning but evening!!! Checked online that evening - no status change to the bag. Day 3, bag still not arrived, although the status said that they know where it is... still can't get a call through the Baggage Services..... got through to someone in the Qantas Frequent Flyer program... they couldn't tell me anything.... what a debacle!", July 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

I feel sorry for the Qantas team on the ground who are well aware of the problem and say that is now the strategy from management. Truly amazing.

10,Terribly disappointing service. Would never recommend Qantas again,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. COVID caused chaos with travel and I understand airlines are doing it tough but I've read so many stories similar in nature to mine about the horrible treatment of customers by Qantas.

I have children in NZ and prior to COVID had regularly flown back and forth, mostly with Jetstar to keep the cost down.
Once travel recommenced Jetstar was not available and so we booked with Qantas who I have been a frequent flyer member with for years.

When booking one of my flights online I forgot to add all passengers. Waited 2.5 hrs to talk to someone on the phone and was told I could add the children left off the original booking simply by creating another booking for them.
After the phone call I tried to create another booking and of course you cannot create a booking for young children alone and there's no option to add them to your booking once completed.
Spent another 2 hours on hold before call dropped. Created another booking for everyone and did online request for credit for 1st booking. I made a number of attempts to have the first booking turned into a refund by attending the Qantas desk at Sydney international, sending multiple emails to the Qantas frequent flyer customer service address, and calling a number of times over the following weeks.
I also had another flight credit for a change in flight plans weeks later and had waited a number of weeks for this credit to appear.
I make a call regarding this credit and I am told Qantas has declined the credit request. Without any communication they pocketed the funds and had not sent any notice about their decision. After listening to me complain the Qantas employee on the phone advised the credit would be authorised and put back onto the card I used for payment. Over a month now and not seen the credit.
I make a call very recently to find out about this credit and I am told it is there however it won't show online as it can only be used by booking over the phone.... Minimum 60 minutes wait for phone calls to Qantas from my experience. There was no communication prior to tell me this credit was available and it appeared online as still being processed.

Details for using credit online state you can book Jetstar flights by calling only.
I find Jetstar flights that suit online and try to book these flights during a phone call to Qantas. They are unable to book my preferred flight as it doesn't show on their system. The only Jetstar flights for around the dates I was looking at that were available to me according to Qantas were flights that were at least double my preferred option. To use my credit I would be out of pocket more than if I were to create a new booking directly with Jetstar.
I say to the Qantas employee, ""So Qantas will only let me use my credit on really expensive Jetstar flights?"" Employee says that is correct....

I have had to make all efforts to contact Qantas as they have not attempted to contact me at all, except for generic replies to some emails of course.

I would not recommend Qantas to anyone. They have completely transformed themselves into the worst airline I've ever used and I seriously doubt any other airlines could take their place, ever.", May 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

On the ground I didn¡¯t see this. Maybe they are like ducks at the moment. Calm on the surface but lots of paddling happening beneath the surface.
Yes there were long lines at the airport - easily dealt with by arriving early and using complimentary lounge invites.
Yes - one of my flight was delayed. What¡¯s new! This happened before covid.
Their staff are working extremely hard in difficult times.
Their staff were helpful with check in, there to answer questions, patient and professional on board the flights.
The planes were clean and covid protocols adhered to.
Bags turned up when and where they should have. Air tags gave piece of mind as well as carrying a spare change of clothing - I did this before covid. Travel is restarting.

Occasionally a supervisor would appear from a door then quickly disappear again. It looked like they were actively avoiding customers. After 20 minutes the 2 staff members behind the desk just got up and left with no explanation. They came back after 20 minutes having left the queue unattended. Eventually some more people arrived to help. I felt sorry for the new helpers as they were all new and didn¡¯t know how to work any of the systems. It appears that customer services is very low on Qantas priorities. Nobody apologised to me at any point for any inconvenience caused.

We were sent to a 2 star hotel 45 min from the airport at 3am. No meals were available at the hotel. No meals were offered by Qantas. I incurred over $100 in taxi claims and have submitted this for reimbursement - there has been no response from Qantas despite now four submissions through their website and three phone calls which are routed overseas where the staff do not demonstrate either empathy or an understanding of processes.

Also be warned, the QANTAS staff have been pre-programmed with a new method to deal with passengers who have been callously disregarded by their employer - they (Johnathon on duty Sydney International 12 Jun 22) will identify you as not being respectful and then in a bullying fashion threaten to have you removed from the next leg of your journey. The threshold for this was simply stating that ""QANTAS doesn't care"". I am a very strong believer in respectful treatment but it is a two way thing and there was nothing in the manner in which QANTAS communicated and dealt with their customers at Sydney that could be consider respectful.
I am a long term QANTAS customer with over 1 million frequent flyer and over 13000 lifetime status credits and I have never been treated this way by this company - if you have a choice do not transition through Sydney and I, sadly, would suggest you look to other airlines that could not treat you worst than QANTAS.", June 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

Landed in Brisbane and there was no announcement that the Brisbane to Canberra sector had been cancelled.

The Brisbane to Sydney was delayed as they were waiting for a Cabin Manager from another flight. The 50 minute connection soon became 7 minutes. Still the polite Gate staff at BNE assured us that we will make it for the CNB flight as there were 71 of us. The flight on the B737-800 was terrible.

The seats were filthy and the overhead panels were covered in dust. The in-flight manager announced that the SYD to CNB flight has been cancelled and we Will be re-booked. I had to wait over 5 hours in Sydney for the next flight.

The Counter staff at Sydney were rude and unapologetic. There was no empathy at all and they seemed proud of the meagre AUD15 meal voucher that they issued.

I finally reached Canberra after a 7 hour delay to find that my luggage had been left behind in Sydney. The guy at the Canberra Baggage counter for Qantas was super rude. He did not offer any assistance and simply told all the affected passengers to fill in a form.

At Calgary discovered at gate my seat had been moved 24hrs (no notice) boarding pass indicated I was booked correctly?? Qantas blamed Westject and my problem to fix. 18hours fighting with Qanats on phone (8 to 9 disconnects after hours eachtime on the phone. Tried to down grade status multiple times, bags lost through to LAX , No accommodation provisions advised, Rerouted three times on flights that could not be connected. Booked but failed to ticket correctly flights on Air Canada so missed actual option available to get home on time. Then booked my on a late flight next day to Vancouver. If I hadn't moved my own flight through West jet I would have missed late Qantas flight from Vancouver to Syd. Transferring through Syd (qantas transfer). Dip s directing people ripped boarding pass in half on assumption I wasnt able to make connecting flight. Counter staff at business asked why my ticket was ripped... pointed to said dip S!?? Looking fwd another trip to YYC next month ... Qantas has already made changes to both my flights and status, Currently sitting on hold trying to correct Qantas screw up. 1hr on the phone already, (on hold) ... looking at unplanned 18hr layover in LAX and arriving 1 day late in Toronto. Changing flight status down from Premium and Business to Economy. Already been on phone early today to track down luggage lost on last trip. Will not ever check luggage with qantas. Will actively look to avoid qantas going forward. I was once a loyal customer but can honestly say its service particularly when stuck is useless. I was stuck in Calgary with no flights and no accommodation and Qantas saying it had nothing to do with them and was others fault. No support whatsoever.

I recently flew qantas to Perth WA when my luggage was lost in the process. i went to the baggage service at Perth airport to enquire about my missing luggage, to give my contact details and a description on my luggage when i was told to wait till the next flight which was 40 minutes away which i did even though it was almost mid night - my baggage didn't come on this flight, i got a call from Perth baggage service at mid night to ask if i had got my luggage which i hadn't, they said they would be in contact the next day but i was never contacted again.. all numbers i could find online would ring just to disconnect other than the 1300 306 980 which was an hour wait to get though at which i was just told the Perth baggage service would be in contact. After four days of no one contacting me i went back into the Perth airport to the baggage service where i was told there was still nothing on my baggage but there was one in Melbourne which matched the description of the content of my luggage at which time they offered to put it on a flight to Perth and i was told i would be able to get reimbursement for the things i had to buy due to not having my luggage by the customer care form which i did soon as i got home from this trip cutting it short due to not having my luggage but no where on the customer care form did it allow me to add receipts or my bank details to where i would like the reimbursement so i once again called the 1300 number which once again took over an hour to get through to be told someone would be in contact in the following 3 weeks which has now past so i have called the 1300 number again today to be told the process team will be in contact in 6 to 8 weeks and they are processing it when i said i don't understand how they are processing the claim when qantas has not given me somewhere to provide my receipts or bank details and how is it now 6 to 8 weeks when i was told by the last person on this same number that it would be 3 weeks which has now past he proceeded to tell me he couldn't tell me and that someone will be in contact soon (in 6 to 8 weeks) i then asked to speak with his supervisor which time he told me this wasn't a case worth escalating he told i would have to call back if i wanted to speak with the supervisor, at which time he hung up on me. i am beyond disappointed with qantas and want to bring awareness to the fact the company does not care about the stress and grief they cause to their customers!!", May 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

On arrival in Auckland, my bags didn¡¯t arrive and was originally told that they were on a later flight and would be delivered the next day to my home. I was given a sheet that had the file reference along with contact numbers for the Auckland baggage office.
I accepted this as acceptable and continued on my next flight home without my bag.
The next day, no sign of my bags so called the 3 phone numbers provided (of which one only worked). The phone just cutoff after the queue greeting.
I then emailed them on the provided email address and never got any replies.
So I completed the Qantas customer form on their website and included photos and contact details. No response.
I then emailed Qantas complaints and filed a grievance. No response.
By now it was day 4 without any idea where my bag was located.
I emailed the manager of the baggage counter at Auckland airport asking her to give me a call. I found her details on their website. I just wanted to talk to a human I said.
At 2130 that night, I got a call from Auckland airport saying that my bag had arrived from Australia and would be sent to my home town that next day and delivered to my home.
I finally had my bag delivered as promised on day 5 at 1530.

don't waste your time and money on Qantas, because you'll end up paying 10 times more in extra hotel fees because you have to wait days for your luggage.
There is absolutely no help to be had for elderly passengers travelling alone.

I was however very disappointed that they were unable to provide me with a basic vegetarian snack option on a recent interstate flight. Everyone on the plane got handed this egg and bacon quiche and I got handed dried Chinese crackers! How is this possible? Being vegetarian is not uncommon anymore. Every restaurant has at least one decent vegetarian option. It is a main stream requirement for more than 12% of the population which equates to 3.1 million people in Australia.

On check out we were charged the whole fare although we had a credit. So after waiting on the phone for over 6 hours I finally convinced them to send me a refund.
Well instead of getting the refund sent right away they inform me it will take 8 weeks before they give me my money. We went Business class if you call it that. The space when the seat in front of me was laid back was no more than 150mm so seemed like economy. We wanted to stay in Darwin a couple of extra days so hoped on the website to see what was available. We decided to change the ticket to economy so we could fly out at a schedule that suited us. It showed it will cost us $6 more to fly economy. Anyway we thought we would pay the extra. Well guess what you cant down grade yourself from business to economy. So we had to call and wait on hold again. Finally after complaining they found us seats on business class at no extra cost. So all was good. It was a 1 am flight so I asked for a blanket but was told they don't supply blankets. Never in all my years of flying I could not get a blanket.

10,"Once again, I am extremely disappointed with Qantas.","Once again, I am extremely disappointed with Qantas.

I called Qantas customer service on the 19th of May to change the flights from the 20th of May to the 27th of May twice. The staff hung up both times when I asked them to escalate the issue regarding the price. The reason for changing the flight was that my son showed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive on a self-administered Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and would not be able to travel the next day. A few hours later, I received a new e-ticket with two itineraries departing on the 20th and the 27th and I was relieved that Qantas understood our needs.

On the 20th of May, I went to LaGuardia airport to confirm that the e-ticket was correct. The American Airlines check-in staff confirmed everything was all right and I asked her to cancel today's flight because my son and wife officially tested positive for COVID-19 at the airport.

Today (25th May), I received a notification from the Qantas app saying that our flights were changed. The Qantas app showed no itinerary for our booking.
I rang customer service and the staff told me that our flights on the 27th were cancelled because I did not pay for the fare difference. The e-ticket for the 27th did not show that I owed anything and I did not receive any notification of an outstanding balance prior to Qantas cancelling our flight two days before our flight home.

What makes matters worse, the staff could not find any seats for the 27th now.

The drama kept unfolding, I paid for the fare difference of $3,006.42 on the 25th with a Visa card and the staff told me that I would receive a new e-ticket in 30 minutes. However, I did not receive the promised e-ticket until the next day, the 26th at 12:10 pm.

I rang customer service and the representative said that the e-ticket had not been issued and she was requesting an urgent e-ticket request to make sure of it because the ticketing office was closed now. I could not believe that. Qantas flies passengers all over the world. I am very sure that Qantas is aware that the world is divided by different time zones.

I finally received the new e-ticket the next day but I could not select our seats. I have a Gold status for the Qantas Frequent Flyer program so I am entitled to this privilege. I rang customer service requesting a seat arrangement so we could sit together. She told me that she assigned us seats 15D, 15E and 15F on the flight from JFK to LAX and 85D, 85E and 85F on the flight from LAX to SYD. When we arrived at the airport, the seats promised to us were not assigned.

Moreover, the check-in staff told me to pay $100 for extra luggage. I told her that I had a Gold status and I was entitled to free extra luggage. Then she said the system did not have the information regarding my Qantas Frequent Flyer.

I was too naive to believe Qantas when they said it was safe to travel again because you can change flights for free. However, in practice, you are at Qantas' mercy when you are changing your flights. Qantas customer service staff were not professional and seats were not always available or were expensive.

Not only was I ill with COVID-19 while dealing with this, but I was also responsible for taking care of my wife and son who were also sick with COVID-19. I had to make sure we had accommodation to safely isolate and a flight home that Qantas promised us but could not uphold.", June 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,"Disgraceful, nightmare, experience","I flew business on Qantas Dreamliner in April 2022 to visit family due to a very long absence and a family medical emergency.
At checkin I was greeted by a surly miserable assistant who couldn¡¯t give me a window seat even though I¡¯d requested one on line and had also arrived early to be first in line. I had also tried from booking my flight to select my seat everyday for both the flights without success. Her attitude was rude, unapologetic, dismissive and couldn¡¯t care less, she waved her hand at me and told me to go to customer services. Then checking my luggage onto the belt she refused to move to assist to help, then after I¡¯d put my case onto the belt she told me to turn it around after seeing me struggling. She insisted the case was to heavy it was below 28kg way below my allowance.
The flight was delayed I then again enquired at the gate to the flight attendant about my window seat who advised me he couldn¡¯t do anything as the seats were all allocated, he advised me to write a letter of complaint to customer service. Paying for a business class return so I could arrive rested and feel comfortable during the flight was not going to happen if I was seated next to a baby. The seat numbers were aisle pods where the bassinet was and directly opposite the toilet.Fortunately that didn¡¯t happen, however worse was to follow.
The seat I was placed in hadn¡¯t been cleaned to a hygienic standard the remote compartment was dirty, I asked an attendant to clean it and he rolled his eyes in disgust at me then briefly wiped the tray, I then spent some time with my wipes cleaning the dirt properly and surrounding areas. Considering Qantas insists on face masks for the flight even though passengers are vaccinated seems to be a contradictory request in view of the fact my seat and the toilets were dirty. Hygiene was slack. One stewardess in particular was the mask police and requested more than once to passengers to put their mask on!
After the long delay, my first meal was served being vegan I¡¯d requested strict Asian Vegan, after previously having a bad vegan meal on a Qantas flight I was concerned I wouldn¡¯t get a vegan meal as the meal requests don¡¯t offer vegan only vegetarian vegan, this isn¡¯t a clear definition. My meal Melbourne to Darwin was disgusting it was a watery Dahl. The only decent edible part was the fresh fruit.
Darwin to London I was again served another version of the first meal I complained to the flight attendant. Obviously it¡¯s not their fault but it had to be voiced. I was later offered breakfast then another flight attendant argued with me that oats and a sourdough crumpet weren¡¯t vegan! and questioned my choice of having the vegan breakfast or the breakfast from the menu, is already been offered the choice of both incase the vegan meal was inedible, breakfast was served the oats were swimming in almond milk and the crumpet was a cold, uncooked soggy lump of dough it went back to be heated and returned much the same. I was by this time so angry that I¡¯d spent thousands and thousand of dollars on flights that were absolutely awful so much for being named the Dreamliner my experience for the first duration was a nightmare.
When I arrived at Heathrow it took me a week to recover from food poisoning from the flight food, this was added to my personal stress. I had paid for this flight wanting to arrive fit and rested to deal with the ordeal of my family¡¯s medical problems instead I felt exhausted and ill.
I wrote as advised to complain to Qantas mid April and haven¡¯t received a reply to either email the first or the second one written on my return home three weeks later.
My return flight was more of the same, delays with take off, exact same food complaints and disappointment at the unacceptable slack sub standard service. The only redeeming part was I managed to reserve a window seat so had a single pod.
The duration with all the delays did not make it any faster or efficient than flying with another airline. The cost for the a business class flight was excessive for the food and service I received. My meal costs for a few dollars worth of lentils and fruit served on a side plate were insulting.
I suggest the CEO take a trip on this flight and order the same meals. If he and I were served this slop in a restaurant you¡¯d get up and walk out without paying. I however had to be subjected to this unacceptable situation both ways and all meals and pay thousands of dollars. I feel ripped off and badly let down.
I also suggest that Qantas put some input and money into employment, they can¡¯t answer two serious complaints within two months but can spend spend spend on advertising and spamming me with notifications about their deals. They can¡¯t answer calls and you can¡¯t speak to anyone.

10,Slip in Service Standards,"QANTAS used to represent the best of Australian aviation service. What does QANTAS stand for today? Quick And Nasty Typical Australian Service. Having been a frequent flyer member for 25 years, the appalling experience today has not only ssaddened me, but impelled me to write this review.

Ok it's difficult times we are all facing, but the service standards of qantas are now unrecognisable as the brand I've supported all these years.

It went like this, tickets booked, Adl Syd Return, informed a week before travel of return flight reschedule.

Original ticketing; depart Syd for return flight 12:40, new flight time depart 10:40. No explanation just stiff luck. Weekend away now cut short.

Day of departure 3 hour delay arrive into Syd hotel at 17:30. Further eating into our break.

Day of return informed at 8:30 am, as we are checking out of hotel (much earlier than we wanted to) 10:40 flight now cancelled. No explanation, no rescheduled time provided.

Do we stay in hotel and enjoy breakfast or go to airport? We decide go to airport to sort out return flight, just in case return flight is early.

Bedlam at Syd airport as many other flights are also cancelled.

On ground qantas reps, rude abrupt and unhelpful. Queue for 'service rep', informed new flight time is 12:10. Thirty min before our original ticketing! Ridiculous.

Make way to Qantas Club (annual fee of $500), staff are rude, snappy and abrupt. This is from entrance to coffee to floor staff, staff talk amongst themselves and ignore guests.

Food below standard, club filthy with dirty plates, glasses coffee cups strewn all over every table.

Can't charge phone as no USB ports in lounge. 3 hour wait in lounge with staff that couldn't care less about customer experience. This is in Australia's biggest city! It's 2022 and after all the talk of being excited to welcome customers back this is acceptable 'standards'.

Board flight, cabin crew surly, no smiles, no attempt to make it a pleasant experience in full knowledge of the delay customers have experienced.

Overhead luggage bins slammed shut, we take off. 'Lunch' is a pathetic sandwich shoved in our face by one of the aforementioned surly crew, with arm stretched out. No explanation, no pleasantries. Collection of 'rubbish' is perfunctory and just as bad as the 'service' delivery.

Summation: what was once a great reliable Qantas experience is now the sub standards of a low cost airline whilst paying premium prices. The customer is now, it seems to me, an inconvenience and the last priority of both ground crew and on board staff. To say its a disappointment is an understatement. Lift your game QANTAS or lose your customer base.

I am still waiting for my refund for the price difference almost 2 months later - I called Qantas today and was told ""it wasn't put through"".

No reply.

I am also chasing hotel points from December last year - the hotel keep telling me they have sent the ""file"" to Qantas who won't process it. Their useless customer service people didn't read my emails properly. I've now sent them the tax invoice and the booking information. No points and no reply (aside from a reference number).

I hope all customers get good service - but I am gold frequent flyer (lifetime silver) so you would hope for better responses than this. I wonder how long poor Bronze people are waiting for a reply...

We lost our preferred seats and were also seated separately on the plane- 45 min on hold on the phone to sort that out. Then a long delay at the airport and a delay in the flying time.

10,6 hours on hold and triple charged 20k,"Mr Joyce asks are we ""battle ready"" for travel? You have one job Mr Joyce, provide a premium level product that gets folks from A --> B safely with as little fuss as possible.

On recent purchase of international flights after 3 years of lock down, your on line booking system triple charged me for the same booking, my only recourse to rectify this over-reach by your IT system was to call the customer help center, I did, it took 5 hours and 30 minutes to get a customer service consultant.

5 hours and 30 minutes, it takes less time to fly from Sydney to Perth! and you have the audacity to say the public needs to be ""battle ready"" for queues and wait times... imagine your plane had 5 hours and 30 minutes less fuel than it required for its flight? Disaster!

It gets worse, after the 5 and 1/2 hr wait not only was the call center (based in South Africa) unable to release my credit card funds from my initial booking, it mad a supplementary charge, that not only failed to issue a ticket it further locked up more of my credit card funds for some pending booking.

Eventually to rectify the situation I drove to Sydney Airport to deal direct with the sales counter, guess what? Mr Joyce closed all of those too. So the nice check counter manager gave me the secret number they use for the call center in Hobart! This time, after only an hour and a half wait, (still quicker to fly to Melbourne), The Hobart booking center (who were really nice btw) were able to finally book and issue me with tickets. I still had to wait a further 14 days for all the overcharges to be refunded! (or more specifically released)

Here is the kicker, Qantas blamed the bank, said it was their fault, but after an ABC News story and follow up on my part, turns out Qantas has over 150 of these double charges per week, that it happens to Commonwealth, St George and Westpac customers, that its not the banks fault and its been happening since November 2021.

Lets hope my analogy does not prove true and that Qantas' commitment to Air safety is better than the systemic failures its booking department exhibits.

In the interests of full disclosure, my issue with Qantas remains unresolved. I have written to their Customer Support expressing my concerns, including but not limited to 'unfair bargaining advantage', poor service, misappropriation and false and misleading statements in the procurement of goods and services. I have heard nothing back.

We had already endured the debacle with Qantas having to offload some passengers' bags in Darwin due to weight problems caused by runway damage there. The possibility that we may not receive our bags in London was only notified to us in a text message on the way to the airport!

10,Last minute trip to sydney,"My Complaint is about a flight and a refund.
I had to travel to Sydney and this was a last minute booking.
I booked and flew on 7th May 2022 wellington to Auckland, Auckland to Sydney reference 53TzDX (this has not been added to my frequent flyer points), I was unable to log onto your web site to choose a seat or request meal option, on arrival to Auckland airport another traveller I got talking to shared her bad experience with your airline and wished me luck, the seat I was allocated wasn't bad for economy but over priced at $856.37 AU , the boxed cold slop that was plonked down in front of me reminded me of school dinners, not nice at all, a row in front and to my right the couple spent the flight getting intoxicated with cabin staff suppling drinks constantly also consuming duty free ,they were disruptive to other passengers and at one stage rather abusive to the two young lady's behind them also the intoxicated female wet her self and continually went past to the bathroom.
I had booked to fly home with Qantas Reference 546KYY this was causing anxiety as I had not had a great experience with my first flight with you, I was able to cancel this flight for a refund only to now follow up to see that the refund will take up to 8 weeks NOT GOOD QANTAS, I was able rebook with Air New Zealand premium economy for much less and 5 star service,
I am in the hospitality and tourism industry and found this whole experience well below average, We travel quite regular and would not recommend Qantas.
Maybe there needs to be some positive changes to your service.
I do understand this complaint will be another to add to the look at later pile and get swept under the carpet.

10,"DO NOT BOOK OR FLY WITH QANTAS - HORRENDOUS SERVICE, TERRIBLE PHONE SERVICE, FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","Qantas has gone from being a great airline to being horrendous. Where to start - my flights to London have been changed/cancelled THREE times - the most recent change being 24 HOURS later than the booked flight. No alternate options provided, no decline option. As part of the booking included a pre-pandemic flight credit, the only way to make changes is via phone. Phone wait times are 1 - 3+ hours, even as a Silver member. I even had to call (2.5hr wait) to choose seats - somehow the Qantas site malfunctions - only to receive an email weeks later to state the flight had been cancelled and I was placed on another flight 24 hour later; 'click to accept'. The audacity to include a note in the email 'we have very long phone wait times, do not call us unless your flight is within 7 days'. No bot to assist. No call-back options. I am hardly going to wait 7 days before a huge international trip to confirm/rebook flights??! AND when I did call (1.5hr) and got put on hold, I was hung up on - suddenly the call terminated. I waited 2 hours - no call back from the customer service agent. These flights cost 4K, and I will pursue a full refund and fly with another airline. Qantas you are bottom of the barrel. Never.

50,Qantas is back!,"I had never flown on Qantas before, but over the previous few weeks, all I was hearing was how horrible they had become in recent months. I had a flyer mile international flight already booked, and the thought of a 16-hour flight with an airline from hell was scaring the bejesus out of me. No lie, for days, I attempted to find a flight on another airline, to no avail. So with the deadline approaching, I resolved to bite the bullet and suffer.

I am in amazement! It was not only a fabulous flight but one of the best that I have ever had! The jet was clean and pristine and one of the most modern that I had experienced. It had swivelling-back-headrest entertainment screens, an alternate rest specifically for ipads and the like, power outlets, and plenty of USB ports, and the headphones had praiseworthy sound quality. Fabulous food, comfy footrests and headrests that adjusted height and flexed to hold my heavy head (the first time the gadget has worked).

But most of all, it was the CREW! From the start, the cabin crew was outstanding. Generous, friendly, and top-notch. Probably the best team that I've ever flown with. From the moment I stepped on, they were accommodating¡ªhelping me get a different seat, providing me with extra treats, always being there for water and grabbing garbage. Amusing and approachable¡ªthey loved their work. I hope you will somehow have the fortune of flying with Jess, Pedro or Poal; if you get one of them on your flight, you are good. If you get all of them, you're golden.

Fortunately, my flight was barely full, and each person had enough free seats next to them to lie down entirely. That reminds me, I have to mention the bedding. For once, I can call it bedding. The pillows were genuine soft pillows, and the blanket was exquisitely pretty and absolutely cozy.

Before disembarking, I had to be straight up with my new mates and warn them of their trip advisor nasty rap. ""Ugh!"" they replied, ""We know! Qantas had a shaky start coming back post-pandemic, but we're back now."" I then confessed that I searched hell and high water for an alternate flight and was now happy to have been unsuccessful. They threw up their hands in unison with mock disappointment. ""How could you betray Qantas so!"" they jokingly gasped. I assured them that it was a big mistake and that I'd write a great review to make it up to them. So here is that review, and I'm hoping that all your loyal flyers get back on board.

We flew 17-5-2022
I was served last with no choice of meal and was told egg and leak pie was my only option. Problem is I¡¯m allergic to egg.
I asked for a sandwich sorry none left was the reply and she didn¡¯t really seem to care at all.
Offered me cheese and biscuits
or a Macadamia slice but I¡¯m allergic to nuts. So nothing to eat on a 3 hour flight at lunchtime.
After lunch served to others they packed the Trolley away and disappeared zero service after 1 hour of flying.
Economy was served before us as our hostess seemed very busy packing a trolley for 4 Business Class passengers.
When we got on and sat down I asked to move seats due to mine being broken and laying back in race position (that I had told them about a week ago on the first flight) seat 4E. No was the answer must keep seat position.
Must be too busy painting them to look pretty and the new livery and not looking after the inside where customers sit.
Filthy chairs with drink down the side from over a week old seat 3A take a look for yourself it will still be there.
Over an hour to get served or even a water on the first flight QF1987 11th May sitting in seats 4E & 4F
45 mins for service on return flight QF1988 17th May same seats both flights on same plane.
Have flown Business internationally with Qantas and more than happy with the service and quality but last time we flew with them domestically was 4 years ago and had similar issues. Nothing has changed.
Will return to Virgin Business much happier staff and far superior service and cleanliness of planes.

30,"Late, no hot drinks and odd moving of passenger","This was the second leg of my flights from Hobart to Canberra. The flight board showed on time and the app was showing on time so I went to the gate as there was not much connecting time. The plane was being towed to the gate and it was obvious that it was not going to go on time. However, nothing was updated - so much for Qantas saying rely on the app!

In the end we left 20 minutes late. There was no real reason aside from some vague comment about cleaning - surely the plane should have been cleaned before it was towed to the gate?

The catering was very average - yet another muffin and no hot drinks offered - just water. At last the entertainment streaming was working on the sector.

On my previous flight I had sat at the exit with no-one next to me, but on this flight, the attendant insisted on moving someone next to me - she said it was just for takeoff and landing?

10,Warning: beware of booking Qantas international,"Last year encouraged by Qantas's reassurance ""we're back!"" I booked a return flight to the US to visit our daughter this July 2022.

A few months ago 1 of 2 legs home on JAL was cancelled and I had to find another way home which I did. But in the last few hours both our Cathay legs to the US have been canceled. The first one I was notified. The 2nd one - nothing. f I hadn't happened to check my account I wouldn't have known.

The QANTAS FF call centre pre-COVID was fantastic - this time the agent was clearly unwell blowing her nose and sneezing, sighing and saying, ""Oh no! Oh no!!"" every time her searches for an alternative flight were unsuccessful. If it wasn't so distressing it might have been funny. One day I will laugh.

Finally asked to be transferred to a 2nd agent to help me use vouchers to see if I could purchase commercial flights instead.

10,Lack of enthusiasm and communication,What a terrible experience. I remember why I don't fly Qantas anymore. From the start the lack of enthusiasm from the start was not welcoming at all. Virgin and Jetstar have far more professionalism than Qantas. My luggage was misplaced from a connecting flight in Sydney. It wasn't the issue of my bag being misplaced but the lack of communication from Qantas to update me on the location and the arrival. I spent 32 minutes on hold on the phone only for it to hang up. It is so hard to navigate on the Qantas website to find out the location and when I did I still have had no response. The brand has been so detached from reality I think its time they put someone less corporate and more employee centric to be at the top of the brand.

First, you cannot call them (I waited 7 hours on hold and others have reported 20 hour waits) so when they cancelled exit seats I had paid for and were confirmed - I couldn¡¯t call to enquire or request a refund. All 3 Qantas flights on my trip were significantly delayed and there was literally no ground staff assistance with domestic transfer in Sydney. The aircraft for the 14+ hour flight is ludicrously packed in economy - if you¡¯re average height there is insufficient space and if you¡¯re a bigger person it is super uncomfortable. The ¡°food¡± was barely edible (in fairness these were vegetarian meals). The only consistent is the staff is really helpful as always.

It was announced that the footpath to the hotel was being repaired & was not in service, but there would be a shuttle bus placed on.

After leaving the airport, we stood around like others, for an hour & a half. No one to ask as the airport was a ghost town.

We left BKK one and half hours late. When we arrived in SYD, the plane pulled up to the gate and turned off seat belt sign. The plane which was about 50% full, people got up and filled the aisles waiting to deplane. After standing for about 15 minutes, the Captain announced they had overshot the landing spot and had to back the plane up to meet the sky bridge, which I always thought was flexible to align with the plane door. So we all had to sit again, and about 40 minutes later finally left the aircraft. After going thru security and passport control went to baggage claim, except there was no baggage. We were told there was a staff shortage and they would get to it. Finally after 45 minutes the bags appeared. It was a trying event to say the least.

When actually airborne with Qantas, the food was the worst I have ever been served on any airline, and, to cap it all, we were bombarded constantly with messages to maintain social distancing on a packed aircraft, which was patently impossible.

This was a full fair ticket for $1152.36 and was made up of two components , the first was the Government 50% off incentive of $576.18 , and my share $576.18. It wasn't a Qantas discounted ticket. Then Victoria went into lockdown because of covid, and we were promised that we could defer the ticket to a later date . That was all very good , but Quantas became greedy and at the end of 2021 they decided without asking the consent of the ticket holder, changed the deferred ticket to a credit , breaking their original promises of deferment.
Qantas not only changed the ticket to a credit but decided to pocket the Govt tax payer rebate off $576.18 for themselves and only credited my $576.18. This is outright theft and steals from the taxpayer and consumer.
I put a complaint in to Quantas and their reply by email was in short they were keeping the Govt rebate because they can and don't care that they are stealing from the taxpayer or the consumer.", February 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

10,Awful experience booking tickets,"I had an awful experience booking tickets with Qantas. I originally booked online, but had to make three calls and spend 11 hours on the phone with Qantas, including many hours on hold, before I received my tickets and itinerary.

I booked my tickets online on Easter Monday (18 April 2022) and chose to pay with BPay, an electronic bill payment system in Australia. Immediately after making the booking, I arranged the payment through my internet banking. Since Easter Monday was a public holiday, my bank processed the payment on Tuesday, the next business day.

However, I did not receive my tickets or itinerary, although I paid. I called on Friday night and the agent claimed that Qantas had not received my payment.

Although I assured her that I could see in internet banking that the payment had been made, she suggested I call my bank to confirm that the payment had been made. My bank would not open for another 3 days, not until after the Anzac Day public holiday. I thought this was a bad solution.

I asked if there was a way to resolve my matter that day.

She collected my credit card details, processed a payment and said I would receive my tickets and itinerary within 24-48 hours. Although I thought my problem had been resolved, it hadn't.

Four days passed. During this time, I tried to get in touch with Qantas through Facebook, but there was no response.

I made a second call on Tuesday. I explained what happened to a different agent. I think his name was John. I didn¡¯t think he was very helpful because I had to explain myself repeatedly. He said that he needed to talk to the ticketing department and would call me back ASAP and would not address any other calls in the meantime.

But he never called back, even after three hours.

So, I called Qantas again and after 3 hours on hold, I explained the situation for a third time.

I asked if there were any records of the previous two calls.

The new agent, Lisa, said that although the previous two agents should have taken notes of everything in the conversations, there were no notes. The only note was one saying that my tickets were cancelled because payment was not received.

After being on hold for a further hour or so, presumably so Lisa could look into the matter, she collected the BPay reference number of the payment and was able to send the tickets and itinerary after a further short wait.

Although my matter was ultimately resolved, I'm unimpressed with the disorderly and inconsistent treatment that I received during the process and how many hours I spent before it was resolved. What was supposed to be a happy time, looking forward to my trip, was anxious for me because of the many days it took to resolve the matter and the broken promises of the first two agents.", April 2022,Legroom: 10 Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

My bank can¡¯t return the money either so for a $3,400 fare for two return flights, qantas have had the best part of $7000 from us. My card has been declined because I had no idea they were taking the second transaction resulting in me being overdrawn. This is absolutely appalling and I would never book flights or fly qantas nor would I recommend anyone to book with them.

10,Qantas care for it customers has gone,"I have been on a family holiday to Hawaii and it is great to be back traveling again but I have to say Qantas service has declined significantly since I last traveled overseas. My flight over was painful enough with delays due to baggage issues, but that is just part of travel at the moment.

Firstly The flight crew were not their normal friendly selves to the point that I had my call attendant button lit up for a good 10 min before I finally saw an attendant walking past and I managed to get their attention.

I am now about to fly home and have woken up to changes in the itinerary my flight has been pushed back from a 10:55am to 1:05pm and I understand that this happens where the problem starts is that now i don¡¯t connect with my qantas flight from Sydney to Melbourne. I have been told that there no flights in the evening between Sydney and Melbourne to get me home. So summary is delayed flight no connection at the other end so an overnight in Sydney before a 6:00am flight to Melbourne and when I asked about being put up in accommodation was told ¡°no we can¡¯t do that¡±. So the expectations is that I will fund my own accommodation or relax in the lounge. What a joke.

I was a platinum frequent flyer and over the last few years with a change in role I have dropped back to gold so maybe my expectations were set too high, but with the service received on the plane and the service through qantas customer service, my experience has been really poor.

10,Absolutely shocking service and rude staff!,"As a global traveller for over 25 years, I've got to say travelling from LA to Melbourne with Qantas on QF12 and QF427 respectively on the 15th April and 17th April has been an absolute nightmare!!
Here's why:
QF12 -
1. Qantas cancelled our flight 2 days prior to our flight time via text without any clue when our next flight would be.
2. 24 hours before our next flight we find our that the direct flight (which we paid extra for) has been re-routed via Sydney and has now added an additional 4 hours onto our initial 24 hour trip.
3. On the LA flight (QF12), there was one incredibly rude blonde staff member who clearly did not want to work or help anyone. After asking her for help to put a bag up in the overheard compartment she responds with ""You'll just have to put it under your legs"". This was when there was plenty of room available in overheard compartments as well, i just needed some help to reach up to it. For a 15 hour flight in business class, no I do not want to have anything near my legs and be comfortable. This was the worst inflight service I have experienced in my 25 years of travelling with Qantas.
4. When we asked for a cheese plate that same blonde staff member (didn't catch her name but she was serving the business class passengers in the top deck) said ""I have put those away and not sure if we have any left anyways"". After asking her to check if there was any left, she comes back and quietly puts the plate down and walks off.

QF 427:
5. On arrival in Sydney we were redirected to a Qantas check-in counter to recheckin our bags could have been fine had their been enough staff, however just 4 counters were open after an A380 flight carrying more than 400 people had just landed plus additional traffic who had arrived from other Qantas flights.
6. On top of all this, it appears Qantas doesn't care whether you pay an 20K extra for a business class seat because business and economy were all waiting in the same queue at the Qantas transfer desk. There wasn't a business class queue. This also continued with the transfer business as Qantas jam-packed the buses with economy, business, families with crying babies and whatnot all on the one bus, unlike other airlines who separate the two classes for customer convenience.
7. On arrival at the Qantas domestic terminal, there were two queues for the security scans one for business and one for economy. However, a bunch of families and other passengers had blantantly walked into the business class queue and Qantas had no security personnel or staff member checking anyone's boarding passes meaning there was really no difference again with paying for a business class flight and travelling cattle class.
8. It is also noteworthy to mention that because of the understaffed Qantas counters at the transfer desk in the Sunday international terminal the line behind us had about 300+ people coming through and many were about to or had already missed their connecting flight to Melbourne as Qantas had only opened a select number of desks.
9. The rude attitude of the majority of the Qantas staff just added to the chaos in the Sydney airport.
10. Prior to boarding the flight from Melbourne to Sydney, one Qantas blonde staff member who was scanning tickets at Gate 1 of Sydney's domestic airport pulled us aside from the business class queue saying we had too many bags. Mind you we had 2 bags each and 1 laptop bag, which as per Qantas policy is allowed for business class passengers. We explained this to the lady at the counter who aggressively responded with ""I don't care who you are and where you're travelling from, you can't take all those bags onboard"". Mind you there were other passengers with the same number of bags who had just walked past. So not sure if the lady was just racist? We also explained to her that we had just got off a Qantas flight on which we had carried the exact same amount of bags with no issue. We also told her that Qantas was the one who cancelled our flight and put us on this one, had we had gone directly to Melbourne this wouldn't have been an issue. The rude staff member just responded with which bag are you checking in because you're not taking them all on board. I was utterly shocked with the service and attitude of both the blonde staff members on both flights in the last 24 hours.

This was THE worst experience in my whole 25 years of travelling with Qantas. To top it off the breakfast tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.

Overall view: Will not be travelling on Qantas anytime in the near future until the incompetent staff are replaced.

30,What has happened to Qantas?,"It saddens me to say this but every experience I have had with Qantas since January has been bad. On a domestic from SYD-BNE they cancelled the flight 45 minutes before departure without explanation. We were handed a $15 food voucher and put on a flight 5 hrs later. Coming back to SYD I had booked a flight for 2pm, then in the days leading up to departure it was pushed back to 3pm, 4pm, 5pm, until finally they settled on 6pm for the service that actually flew. That gave me less time to connect to my international flight to LAX, and when I got there I saw that they had without warning changed the scheduled 787-9 aircraft to an A380. No complaint there, right? Except that the In Flight Entertainment on that 14 hour flight was not working across the entire aircraft. It really feels like amateur hour at Qantas these days, especially when I compare these shenanigans to the efficient service I have experienced domestically in the US on American and Delta, supposedly inferior airlines which nonetheless manage to provide the services they offer, on time, and who manage tight-connections efficiently with no loss of baggage. Qantas has a much smaller and easier network to manage, they have had all of the pandemic to prepare for full service, and they are failing miserably so far.

10,Worst experience of my life,"Qantas has turned my first trip to America into a nightmare
My travel agents booked me On QF 7 to Dallas

This was delayed (by 6hrs !!!) so I missed my next flight to Jacksonville with American Airlines

Upon arrival in Dallas I was not given the next flight to JAX and had to stay overnight in hotel that was apparently ¡°booked¡± for us, and only knew this once you turned up at the hotel.

To make things worse my wallet was stolen on the plane and upon finding out staff were alerted but did nothing to reassure, they proceeded to look through my stuff with a torch and question my integrity.

So after experiencing a stressful and upsetting time on the plane I was given no transfers for airport to the Sheraton with the apparent ¡°booked room¡± and no staff to talk to

I was then routed on United Arline (which wasn¡¯t what was on the ticket originally) to Houston then to JAX . United airlines is not one world carrier even

Just now that flight is delayed and I was rudely told to get on the next plane to Chicago then another to JAX
UA people said QF did this
What a nightmare

My travel agents called the agent help line which no one answers as it is a public holiday and are closed was the recording

QF is faceless and can not ever talk to anyone
Even our consolidator spent 3 hours on the QF agent help line number before they were answered

The CEO , Exec team and Board must not care about customer service at all so far removed from reality

The website wouldn't allow us to change the flight date to any other day if the same week even though flights were available, leaving only the option to cancel and take a credit. THIS IS A TRICK!!!!... Once you click cancel, from a consumer Law perspective it was YOU who cancelled the booking, at which point Qantas have no further obligation to fly you at the original fair. The ticket prices had gone up 30%, and what Qantas we're trying is to get more money.
The Australian customer service line (13 13 13) is a joke, and no calls get answered in under two hours. When I was finally front of the phone queue, the operator simply hung up! They avoid providing an Australian customer service email address for the same reason... To ensure that your only reasonable option is to take a credit on the website, and then rebook at a much higher price.

10,Forget Qantas at the moment,"Here is an email that explains why you should not trust or use Qantas. Stephanie Tully is a top dog in Qantas who's name appears in their group apology emails.

Hi Stephanie,

Thanks for the recent email trying to explain the woeful phone service we've been putting up with.
Our first flight was cancelled so we put up with a lesser quality service to get to Cairns. Due to the flight change we couldn't change our return date online (not allowed).
We spent 4 hours plus of our holiday on hold to Qantas to change our return flight to jetstar 8.00am tomorrow. REF xxxxx
Tonight we received news that our flight tomorrow has been cancelled. We stupidly wasted an hour on hold to jetstar knowing they couldn't help us with a Qantas flight as all of there's were 15 hours plus ordeals (Darwin is a 2.15 flight direct) and they have no access to Qantas systems apparently.
I'm currently 2 hours 30 minutes into a call with Qantas to hopefully get home tomorrow....
If you wonder why people get p'd off then here is a great example.
Can you get us home and refund the dinner my wife and I spent listening to Qantas annoying hold music and propaganda?
I will be avoiding flying for the next 12 months at least and hopefully in that time some decent competition emerges so we don't get messed around again by Qantas.
Do better or go out of business, I don't care about Qantas at all. And please stop wasting money on TV ads, they are sickening and jingoistic. Its sad you can't answer a phone call in 4 hours.

10,Double Charged AND 1 Full Hour Waiting at The Baggage Carousel.,"Not only have I paid twice, twice (so that¡¯s 4 times for 2 flights), this week, I stood at the carousel for an hour waiting, it¡¯s not like they were busy because NOBODIES luggage came out.

If I remember correctly Qantas was paid by the Australian Government to keep the service running so there wouldn¡¯t be a problem when pandemic restrictions were lifted. Clearly Qantas collected our tax dollar with no intention of maintaining an acceptable level of service.

I have always preferred to fly Qantas because the service was better and if plans changed they made it easy to change.

After listening to the CEO.blame customers for the debarked at Sydney airport, will he take any responsibility for the double fare rip off and hour long waits for baggage.

10,Dont,"Booked with Qantas and paid for our trip. Got confirmation from Qantas. Emails from them a few days later wanting to change a flight time and they needed our agreement......when we tried to agree they wanted the flight paid for again. Tried the enquiry number 2 hour wait....tired late at night....2 hour wait....tried early in the morning...2 hour wait. Went to Qantas office in Brisbane...they had closed it and moved. Went to Brisbane Airport...they have closed the Qantas Domestic travel enquiry desk. Spoke to International Desk...very helpful...handed me a phone!!! 10 minute wait turned into an hour with other domestic passengers now waiting also. Asked for manager...she turned up gave her my receipt for the payment details and she went away...came back and said I should wait on the phone....asked to speak to her manager...her response? Alan Joyce!!! challenged this and she admitted her supervisor was not on site. She went back to her office for another go and suddenly the phone answered. Explained the problem and Qantas rep admitted all their fault and they did not have the money our bank said they had. Suggested we pay again....we indicated that we would do so but if our bank confirmed we had paid twice for the same tickets to Qantas we were off to the Qld Police.....Qantas rep virtually hung up in my ear but I convincer her to chat to the next passenger and she agreed but after I handed him the phone Qantas rep hung up in his ear!!!
Back to Westpac....very helpful...stated Qantas had our money & if it wasn't refunded within a week Westpac would lay a complaint with Qantas and recall our funds....conveyed all this to Qantas including Alan Joyce...a week later no response to the emails...back to Westpac...still very helpful.

20,"Customer service is abysmal, technical errors and more!","I got my flights to Japan on special. All seemed well. Got my ticket. A little over a month before departure, they cancelled one of my flights and converted my entire trip to flight credit.

The flight credit page didn't let me book the flights I needed. I could fly to Christchurch to Tokyo or Sydney to Osaka but not Christchurch to Osaka. So I called them, waited nearly 4 hours before the representative answered and rebooked me with a $119 fare difference charge. I was billed but never got a receipt for my payment and never received a ticket.

I've since called them another 3 times, all a few days apart from each other, asking for my tickets. Each time the wait has been around 4 hours or more. Each time they've told me that my tickets would get emailed to me and each time they haven't. I have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to make plans in Japan cause I'm not sure that I can fly there.

10,Horrendous customer service,"We¡¯ve been on and off the phone with qantas for WEEKS. Each call had a waiting time of 4-7 hours¡­ yes SEVEN! In more than one occasion, someone would pick up and literally hang up the phone. In MAJORITY of them, we would be out on hold while customer service ¡°talks to the manager¡± and the call would just cut and we¡¯d have to queue again for another 4-7 hours. It¡¯s ridiculous.

Majority of the customer service staff have no idea what they¡¯re doing. They can¡¯t do the most basic task. I don¡¯t know why the Qantas app or website cannot simply allow their passengers to change their flights online like every other airline but they force us to call their customer service team to do it for us and they can barely do it.

My husband needed his flight changed from the 3rd of April to the 16th and it literally took 5 tries. 5 different customer service representative and 5 times of us queuing for 4-7 hours cos each of them can¡¯t do their job. Each one will say they will call us back when they hear back from another team and literally NONE OF THEM CALL BACK. They say the change is confirmed but we have NOT received any e-ticket or any form of anything confirming the change.

We are talking to the 6th representative as I type this and she¡¯s telling us that there was actually an error and the tickets were never sorted. She trying to fix it now but I honestly have no confidence that it will be sorted and we¡¯ll just have to cancel the ticket

The other issue is they had a promotion running on the 18th of March where if you bought points, they would add a bonus of 50%. We were meant to get 75,000 points in total but instead, our money was just taken and no points were given.

We¡¯ve tried sorting this out with qantas each time we talked to them and we¡¯ve sent photo proof of the purchase to the email they requested and we have a reference number and everything. 5 people have promised to give us a call back to inform us about what happened with our points and not a single one of them have called back.

I spent hours trying to reach someone in customer service and then once someone finally answered my phone the experience was horrible. They tried to lie to me telling me I can't use my credit for international flight, although it clearly states in the flight conditions that I can - if I call them. Then they said I can only use half of my credit for international flight... Seriously?! And the last one was I can't combine credit with my Qantas pass...

Lounge Access: They let us use the first class lounge due to not enough travellers to use both lounges which was amazing.

Seats/Suites: The suites are spacious and have great amenities (including massage functionality!) The pyjamas were a nice touch too. The amenity bags were a bit lacklustre for how much you pay for the ticket - also on my flight they ran out of amenity bags and did not receive one. I couldn't even get a spare one from economy - which made sleeping without an eyemask pretty awful.

Food: The food in both the lounges and on board was amazing, fresh and presented beautifully. I wish they had given us proper salt & pepper shakers, the salt packets I had on the return leg were soggy, even the replacement one was too. Also, the cutlery is awkward and strangely designed.

I was not able (after umpteen attempts online)to purchase extra baggage before my flight at the reduced rate and was henceforth forced to pay the full rate at the time of checking in.

10,Please find another country to call home Qantas,"I used to love Qantas. Now I hate it. Hours and hours on the phone to fix the issues they themselves create..... and that's if you are one of the lucky few who ever get your calls answered. God help those poor passengers who are being messed around by all the cancellations at the last minute etc. My issue was merely trying to have Qantas send me the necessary information about a flight credit they owed me from a cancelled flight last year (they'd apparently sent the email to an email address I had 20 years ago, and which I have updated with them at least three times over the past two years). Funnily I seem to get 4 emails a day from them about things I never asked to receive (Qantas Frequent Flyers, Qantas Wine, Qantas travel, Qantas Rewards etc. etc.) BUT nothing useful like my flight credit!

So 3 calls and 6 hours on hold - keeping myself occupied by reading through various review sites about the disgraceful way Qantas is now treating all their customers, left me feeling very sad. How a once-great airline can be reduced to something I would expect from a third-world carrier in just a few short years is appalling. Other airlines (many of which DIDN'T get the massive splash of cash that Qantas got from Australian taxpayers to keep things going during Covid) have managed to still put customers first by at least having the necessary staff to keep people informed and respected.
So why not Qantas? Clearly their executives are looking after no-one but themselves.

I'm sure if absolutely nothing goes wrong (or if you have a priority rating which gets you direct access to staff who will help you), then things will be fine. No doubt bulk-bookers, frequent business high flyers and government types who have agents to do all their bookings have special ways to get assistance where required. But for the average mug traveller thinking that Qantas is still a reputable and respectable airline - stay away. At present we clearly are not their priority.

10,The worst airline i have ever used,"ohh where do i start. So i book a one way ticket from Brisbane to Kuala lumpur, it was very late at night when i booked and i made a mistake, on one of the passanger name i missed one letter...one single letter. How hard can this be to fix?

The flight was a mix of 2 flights Qantas + Malaysia Airline

I call qantas with a call back service, after 4 hours i get a call back from their support, i explain the situation but nothing can be done because allegedly the other airline was preventing them from updating the details.

So a good customer service would have told me not to worry, they'll fix it, maybe it might take a few days and that's it.

NOT Qantas, the advice was I call directly Malaysian airline and get them to change. The second advice was to send them an email expalining the situation using the email on the website.

Now what do you think another airline would tell you if you aske them to change a flight booked on the Qantas website and paid on the Qantas website?

You guess right, the simply won't do it and ask for Qantas to contact them.
What abot the email on the website...ohh ther is NO EMAIL on the website to contact customer service.

So i call again, this time don't even get the recall option so i wait 4 hours on the line.
Same advice again, i have to contact the other airline and fix it.

At this point i was a bit frustrated so i decide to cancel the flight, easy process except to get the money back...8 weeks! Now my flight was a sub 1000$ dollar, what if it was 10.000$? And still in 2022 with this BS when it comes to refund, it took half a second for my money to leave my account why 8 weeks? in 2022?

Ok you might think i'm done, i go and check my account only to find they charged me twice and i mena not a pre authorization and an actual charge, I mean 2 SEPARATE CHARGES. Again immagine if it ws a 10.000$ flight?

20,Reasonable flight but with poor food and inattentive service,"If you're travelling business class, you expect a decent experience. This wasn't it.

to be fair, the inflight staff were friendly and, for the most part, attentive. However, if they have taken things away to hang them up, you really shouldn't have to chase them to go find your things when you arrive at the destination. The woman across the aisle from me was disabled and needed staff assistance with her crutches. At the end, they forgot about her and only came running when she started calling for her crutches so she could disembark.

As for the food. Well, a letdown.

I had Caribbean Pork with a pineapple salsa and rice. Stone cold. Rice cold and stuck together in congealed lumps. The pineapple salsa was a third of a slice of pineapple cut into little bits. Sorry, you need a little more by way of ingredients to convert a chopped fruit into a salsa. The pork was substantial in size but was flavourless. There were no discernible spices and couldn't by any stretch be called Caribbean. I know - I lived in the Caribbean for several years.

Later I had bacon and eggs with mushrooms and tomatoes for breakfast, with toast and marmalade. All stone cold.

The red wine: they has shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. There's nothing like a good red wine and this certainly was nothing like a good red wine. Acidic and one of them was distinctly fizzy - it would make a damn good paint stripper.", March 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
10,No e-ticket - flight oversold & bad service,"I booked a business class ticket to Adelaide from Brisbane 2 weeks before departure.

After booking I've never received an e-ticket or confirmation per email. I was only able to see my booking online and on the Qantas app.
I didn't change any of my existing details with Qantas and on the same email address I've received tickets and confirmations before.
After that I've tried to request an invoice online multiple times which ended in receiving an error message. I also tried to call customer service, which I gave up after waiting 1 hour in the queue and the offered call back never came.

Before the flight I checked in online which worked fine and received my confirmation of check-in and my boarding pass.

Then, 2 hours before departure I received a call from Qantas and they told me the flight is oversold and I have to take the next one, which is 10 hours later or downgrade to economy class.
Due to I had to be in Adelaide at a certain time I didn't have a choice and agreed to take the economy ticket, mostly I fly economy anyway.

When I asked what the price and the refund is going to be it turned out Qantas charges me $800 for a eco-flex ticket which usually only cost $600, and I know because I have booked that ticket multiple times before and even my return flight is eco-flex for $600.
The lady on the phone told me she can only give me the currently available price which of course is much higher 2 hours before departure.

So, not only am I downgraded shortly before the flight, on top of that I am punished for Qantas mistake of overselling and have to overpay for a ticket just to get to my desired destination in time without being offered a better deal or any kind of compensation.

It's really not nice to feel being taken advantage of because I have a schedule.

Unfortunately Australia doesn't have many airlines to choose from and they get away with bad customer service. I guess they need more competition to be forced to improve their services.

I never experienced such a bad customer service in over 10 years of frequent flying. 90% of my over 200 flights were done with Star Alliance and they offer great service.
That really makes me miss the times back in Europe where airlines can't afford bad service and still value their customer especially when flying business class.", March 2022,Legroom: 10 Seat comfort: 10 In-flight Entertainment: 10 Customer service: 10 Value for money: 10 Cleanliness: 30 Check-in and boarding: 30 Food and Beverage: 20

Qantas - I woke up to a duplicate charge of $5,114.16 on my Westpac statement. I was told it would be 7 business day before the money would be returned. Unacceptable.

10,Impossible to Use Voucher,"I bought tickets NZ-BR early 2020 and due to Covid flights were cancelled. A voucher was given and now that I am able to use it, after the route that I need is active again, I am forced to wait on the phone since they don't give me the option to use the voucher online. I waited for more than 3 hours each of the last 3 days and am waiting for 1 hour now while typing this...
At the time a refund was offered but due to airline cashflow issues we decided to opt for a voucher, which turned to be a terrible decision. There are only disadvantages in asking for a voucher since they say you need to pay the +50% price increased fee and you can't book online so Qantas makes us waste our time waiting for absolutely nothing.
The time I spent on the phone waiting is longer than what I will spend on the flight (if I ever have the chance to book it).

10,"On the phone for hours, then purposefully hung up while trying to use the credit","I purchased a ticket directly from Qantas in late 2019 and because of COVID, needed to cancel my return flight to Australia in 2020. I was given a credit voucher - worth a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne (that¡¯s what I was told on the phone and later confirmed via email).
Somehow already then - someone accidentally messed my ticket (first they gave me a credit voucher worth of 0$ by accident, then they corrected that to a credit worth around $430, and finally they corrected it to the original promise when I canceled the ticket - to another credit worth a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne) and my credit and that¡¯s why nobody cannot find the reference number in your system. I have however probably tens of phone calls and emails proving that this is accurate.

Then the voucher was extended first with one year and later on until Feb 2023 to be used, and I¡¯m now trying to use it for flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne.

I¡¯m trying to fly back to start my PhD, which I was suppose to do in March 2020 originally.

I have been trying tens and tens of times to reach out a customer representative at Qantas over the phone and with numerous emails. Only in the past week, I have been on the line on the phone waiting for approximately for 2,5 hours per day and when I finally get through and explain my case, the phone call always somehow (magically) cuts off. I have started to ask for the staff to send me an email in case this will happen again but I have never received a single email nor have I been able to book my ticket with the credit voucher that I currently have.

I have called to several different numbers (in Scandinavia, US and Australia) and during some of the phone calls - the customer representatives have only told me that they cannot help me and that I should fly from my current location (Mexico) to either Dallas or to Los Angeles to physically go to the office desk to be able to book my flight with my credit. I really don¡¯t find that fair and have no guarantees that I will be able to book the flight.

The flight left on time (you would hope so given it was the only flight leaving in that whole hour)

Check-in was smooth as it can be given you had some people who didn't do their VTL correctly so caused some line hold up.

Food was ok but was in good quanitity and offered regulauriy.
I found service was good, place was only 1/3 full so staff probably had more time.

The pilot was also nice enough to tilt the plane so we could have a look at Uluru and The Olgas which was a nice gesture.

10,Worst customer experience I've ever encountered,"Where do I start?

First I'll qualify that all my calls to Qantas customer service have been prompted by multiple changes and cancellations THEY'VE MADE to my original flights e.g. didn't update my connecting flight (so I'd be leaving on the connecting flight, before I'd actually taken the first flight), failed to issue me tickets for their changes, transformed a 21 hour journey into a 37 hour journey, with a 10 hour stop-over. Note that in most instances I didn't receive an email notification that there had been any change, I just happened to notice it on my Qantas app.

- Twice I've been suddenly disconnected while explaining my situation to the operator, having been on hold >1 hour.
- Twice I've been told they would issue me an e-ticket, and flights on my Qantas app would be updated within 24 hours (my app said one leg of my flight was cancelled. Apparently it wasn't, but I had no ticket and an app telling me otherwise). It took 3 calls to get an e-ticket and for the app to update.
- They advertise a customer care phone line in Ireland on their website. When you call you'll be put on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes, and then cut off. I know this because when it first happened I was confused why I'd suddenly been disconnected and tried again. At exactly the same time interval the second time, I was again cut off.
- Once when I got through to them, I was informed they couldn't resolve my query at that time, and committed to call me back. No call.

10,Poor customer service,Qantas was once a highly rated and respected airline. It is not anymore and given their customer service it is easy to see why. A simple request for a seat allocation has so far meant 3 calls and over 3 hours on hold. Even though my frequent flyer profile says that I prefer an aisle seat (for health reasons) I was given a window seat for a nearly 15 hour flight. When I rang to see if it could be changed I was told it was the only seat available. That didn't seem correct as there were still plenty of seats available on the flight so I rang back to be told there was an aisle seat and they would change it and confirm in about an hour. 5 hours later there is no confirmation and I have been on hold for 90 minutes., March 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null

20,Honest letdown,"So I flew qantas from Sydney-Lax return ticket.
I understand we are still in the pandemic but this was a complete let down and is the last time I will fly this route with them or any route.

1. service wasn't the best - Food was very disappointing

2. Sydney to LA we flew on the new Dreamliner. How is is that in 2022 Qantas do not have WIFI as an inclusion on their flights as an option to anywhere yet?
Dreamliner being their newest aircraft one would think that this would now be part of the service. Seriously, if i flew Business OR 1st Class I would be be so annoyed that I paid thousands to not have this service, especially in business class of all options. WHY??? isn't WIFI a THING yet with Qantas. C'MON get with the program.

United airlines have it
Virgin Australia have it
Philippine airlines have it
United Airlines have it
?????? I'm sure there is many more airlines that have it too.

3. Now that Australia is flying again, start getting competitive with your prices.

4. CHECKED BAGGAGE - Qantas have reduced the number of checked bags we can take. you are only allowed 1 checked bag if you fly Economy & depending on your ticket you book at a max of 32kg. If you need to check any further bags its $150 PER ANY EXTRA BAG. Honestly this leaves me SPEACHLESS.

5. On my flight back the variety on the tv entertainment system was absolute garbage. only a few movies, programs, comedy, Australian (movie&shows)

I was always a Virgin Australia girl because they are or were good but haven't resumed flying to LA from Sydney yet, but for now i will only fly with an airline that has wifi as an option or at-least free IMESSAGE.

i flew on a few domestic routes in the US while i was on vacation and every flight had either WIFI or iMessage as an option.

The only POSITIVE feedback that I can include in this review is that i was lucky enough to have a full row of 3 seats to myself so because the entertainment system being a letdown, I slept flat for 9 hours of the 14 hour flight and it was the most comfortable feeling and I was so happy and impressed that I was lucky enough to be able to do this for the 1st time ever on any-flight but thats only because the flight was only 60% capacity and it was the A380 that I flew back home on.

They told me that it was scheduled to be on the next flight into Melbourne and my bags would arrive at the airport by 9am the next day, be processed through customs, and delivered around 12 in the afternoon. 1pm the next day, STILL NO BAGS. No call, no email, no text from Quantas. So, I decided to check the ""Mishandled Baggage Report"" that the Quantas employee instructed me to use. The website did not work and kept saying to ""refresh the page and try again"". So, i decided to call the baggage service phone number and I was on hold for 2 hours before someone finally answered. He informed me that the website Quantas gave me did not work (which I already knew) and that i was needed to use ""worldTracer: to see updates about my bags. He also told me that my bags were not on the flight that I was told they would be on and that they were actually going to arrive much later than I was told and I should be receiving my bags around 5-6pm. At 6pm, STILL NO BAGS. Around 6:30pm I got a call from the front dest of my hotel asking if I was missing baggage because a Quantas employee was asking for my information. WHY WOULD THEY CALL THE HOTEL AND NOT ME?! THEY HAD MY PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE CONTACTING ME TO TELL ME IF THEY'RE WERE ANY CHANGES, WHEN MY BAGS ARRIVED, AND WHEN THEY WERE OUT FOR DELIVERY. The hotel receptionist told me that my bags would be delivered between 8-10pm. It is currently 10pm and STILL NO BAGS. So, I try to call the baggage services phone number again and they are closed of course. So who knows when/if i will ever get my bags.

The Flight Centre who we booked though originally have to book these flights on our behalf and they want us to pay an additional $300 over and above the $3000 which we have in credit. When asking for an explanation, the Flight Centre have basically told us that Qantas will simply charge us the value of our credit for the flights - and then an additional $300 on fare and tax difference!!!

10,"Worst support ever, most airlines way better","Second time I have flown with this airline and I pray that I will have more choice in the future as I can say nothing good about this airline.

Tried on Facebook messenger to find out what time check in started at Suvarnabhumi Airport ( and I stated airport not online) but they said online so asked again, and again they said about online check in so asked again and finally they said when it should open.... and then they block me on messenger!!!

The flight was uncomfortable compared to both Singapore and Malaysia who I normally travel with.. and food... well what a joke that was, and on both Singapore and Malaysia food way better and far bigger choice of entertainment.

I had just signed up for frequent flyer before this and after flight I thought I don't want to have anything to do with a joke airline like this and requested that my frequent flyer account be deleted.

I have sent at least four emails trying to leave and received about the same back and each one stuffing me around.. the last one said it had been closed, but the next day I got promotional email with my membership number and when I checked saw they just locked it.

We provided bank details to Qantas in October as requested, no refund. We called in December, after a 3hr wait, Qantas sent an email assuring us the funds would be in our account in 10-14 days. Mid January no refund. Called again, another 'reassurance' by Qantas that we would be refunded within 10-14 days. It is now mid February and no refund. So poor.

30,Poor Service .....,"Domestic flight from Brisbane to Darwin was just OK. Flight attendant was good.
The business lounge at Brisbane was good. Business lounge at Darwin was PATHETIC.
The enterance to the business lounge at Darwin was through the International Departure, and that was only opened at the last minute (airport was empty) and had no time to get a drink. The business calss flight to London Heathrow from Darwin was a NIGHTMARE. We had a 3 year old spoilt brat with parents in front of us, and for the first 15 hours of an almost 18 hour journey the brat was SCREAMING, and nothing was done by the flight attendant or the brats parents.
The flight service was mediocre, and removing of empty plates in front of us felt like a lifetime.
The business lounge at London Heathrow was very, very good with excellent service, drinks and food. The flight attendants on our journey back home carried on as if they were doing us a favour. They were only a couple of the attendants that were really caring.
Would we travel with Qantas again ????? I don't think so !
For the money we paid for travelling in comfort, it was far from comfort with the experience we had. Qantas ought to take NOTICE of what travellers have to say and try bloody hard to improve their image. Right now their image needs a great deal of Photoshop work to get them looking good.

10,Qantas Contact Phone Nightmare,"Calling Qantas and its super service promises leaves you at first with an impression of superb service and customer friendliness. After some minutes, however, the superiority of promised service turns quickly into frustration.

The continuous repeat of e.g.:
? changing travel dates, no problem etc.
? service is our highest priority etc.
? seat selection etc. and changing booking through 'manage booking'...
? peace of mind when booking and
? flexibility to change ...
? safety & wellbeing and even hand sanitizing stations (what an achievement Qantas)
? visit Qantas for more information, Qantas app etc.
? thanks for calling Qantas... service fees but book online and
? QF points to gain at a multitude of partners...
? QF destinations great way to discover the world ... resumimg in a few months

and all this talk with only some 5 seconds of 'music' in between becomes a nightmare in particularly when one must wait for hours.

All this phone call requirement because of the unavailability of the 'manage booking' facility online, not comprehensible, just bad IT, I guess.

This scenario was experienced by me in October, when I waited for 1.5 hours.
Early December I waited again for 2hours 38 Minutes, spoke to a Qantas agent in Capetown in South Africa again and was promised to get a refund of the taxes and points balance credited. I was told that the refund and credit of points would take some 5 to 7 days. Nothing happened by 31 January. Qantas Service as it is.

I waited in the morning of 31 January at home for 1 hour 25 minutes on a call to Qantas, then I got Jeff on the line from Qantas Capetown RSA. Unfortunately, the call at the South Africa-end was so bad and crackly, that I could not hear most of the comments from Jeff. I managed to have him confirm his intention to call me back, I left my number. This never happened! Qantas service at it is!

I had enough and thought when driving to the airport, that I could approach the service desk and perhaps I would get help with the booking change. What an erroneous assumption.
I went to the airport, via the toll bridge and parked in the Airport-Parkhouse.
In the terminal the friendly Qantas airport staff informed me that there is:

? No more booking service desk at the airport
? No Qantas office in the city of Brisbane in fact likely nowhere else in the country
? But there are two telephones at the former service desk at the BNE airport where I could call reservations. Qantas service at it is!
? I received a short dial number from a lady at check-in next and was told that it might take some 10 minutes to get through to reservations, what an erroneous assumption.
? The friendly airport staff told me -to my surprise- that they would also call this number, as the employment of reservation staff was terminated a few days ago (There was nothing I could do and they were also extremely frustrated)
? and all reservation work was outsourced by Qantas Management to Capetown RSA
? Qantas airport staff are only able to get into the check-in system but are unable to change bookings/reservations for customers
? and that the QF airport staff had to also use the number, there was no other way to contact reservation?! Qantas service at it is!
? A gentleman with his autistic son had to also use the phone, next to me, in order to advise Qantas, that due to an accident on his way to the airport he would miss the flight and requested a re-arrangement of his travel itinerary!
? hard to imagine calling Qantas and having to wait for hours to get a response
? after 'my neighbour' was apparently lucky to get through to reservations - after some hour 15 minutes wait at the counter ""only""
? no convenience like a chair was considered to be provided
? he got through and his itinerary from BNE to Alice via Darwin etc. was adjusted with some considerable effort, I was able to continue with the call and
? I was then able to speak to the efficient reservation lady and got my flights confirmed and received afterwards a confirmation in the mail
? I was able to hang up on my airport convenience call after one hour and 55 min (I made picture of the phone as evidence last after 1hour 38 minutes.
? cost for me: $30 parking, petrol, toll, time and endless frustration

When I had to change my flight from BNE to MEL return, on 21 October 2021, Qantas changed the flight without my knowledge and approval various times afterwards, even once where the originating flight came out of MEL rather than from BNE. I chose to ignore this at the time of these inexplicable adjustments.

To blame Covid for these actions and inefficiencies is not acceptable. To delete service desks at all airports, city centres and offices in the land by relying on phone services only (prior to assure effective functioning!) is inconsiderate, in particular to the elderly. Not to increase reservation capabilities but to seemingly and deliberately outsourcing services to another country shows no consideration for a once great service company and lack of Australian attitude. To explain these actions with monetary efficiencies and increases of revenues might be a driver but these actions and decisions by Qantas senior management show considerable lack of customer focus and empathy for a lot of customers.
I am sure not to be the only frustrated customer.

10,TERRIBLE customer service - 7months and still waiting for refund,"Extremely disappointed in Qantas - VERY difficult to contact customer service and when you do get through the operators are mostly unhelpful. My flight on July 18th 2021 was cancelled due to covid and I have yet to be refunded despite:
-20 phone calls, total of 556mins - most ended by being cut off with no call back despite requesting one
-5 unanswered emails
-1 unanswered official complaint in December LAST year.
-refused repeatedly the request to speak with a manager/supervisor to get it resolved

I also had cancelled flights with AirNZ, Virgin Australia and Jetstar and was able to receive refunds from all three companies within 2-3 weeks . It is almost 7 months after my flight with Qantas and I am no closer to getting a refund. It is embarrassing for such a big, 'well developed' organisation.

30,Poor service,"Poor service
I flew from Sydney to Johannesburg (South Africa) on Friday 14 January and returned on Sunday 30 January 2022. The return trip was a pleasure from start to finish but the forward trip left a lot to be desired.
At Sydney airport on 14 Jan, I together with many other people waited in line for about an hour just to have our documents checked before proceeding to check-in. These document checks had to do with COVID vaccination, PCR tests etc. The Qantas staff at Sydney airport seemed to work very slowly and were in no rush while we waited to be served. While I accept that some passengers probably didn¡¯t have their documents in order, the service was simply unacceptable and is no pleasant way to start a long, overseas flight. No-one even offered water to all of us standing in line and there were some elderly people whom I think must have been struggling. By contrast, I should point out that check-in for the return flight from South Africa, which was handled by African staff working for Menzies Aviation, was quick, efficient and the staff were exceedingly polite.
When booking my ticket to Johannesburg, I ordered gluten-free meals. When I checked in at Sydney airport, after the hour-long wait in line, the staff member even confirmed my choice of gluten-free meals. Onboard the flight to Johannesburg, I noticed that other people who had ordered special meals were served before everyone else but I was simply left out. I was in fact about the last passenger to be served onboard and the staff didn¡¯t even know that I¡¯d ordered gluten free meals or else they simply didn¡¯t care; I must say that their general service was subpar. On the return flight, the staff were well aware of my request for gluten free meals and their service was good and they were polite.
I must say that the service provided by Qantas staff at Sydney airport and on the flight to Johannesburg was well beneath my expectations and quite unacceptable to me.

Ticket-price & changes
When I initially booked the ticket to Johannesburg, I chose to buy a flexi ticket for both sectors ($3100) which related to my concern over possibly contracting COVID and that I might be forced to buy a whole new ticket if that happened. There were, in fact, only flexi fares available for the return sector.
I wanted to extend my stay while in South Africa by changing my return flight from Sunday 30 January to Friday 4 February and despite having paid for a full flexi-fare, Qantas wanted to charge me an additional $450 to change my return flight (yes you read that correctly)! While return flights were initially available on 4 Feb and 6 Feb, after a while these dates were simply blocked out and the soonest return flight that was available was Wed 9 Feb. I checked this several times to ensure that this was in fact the case. Unless the scheduled flights on 4 and 6 Feb were completely full, which would be highly surprising as my flights were far from full, this sudden blocking out of flights is quite unprofessional, quite apart from the extortionate fees to change even a flexi ticket.

My advice is, be careful when considering flying to South Africa with Qantas, despite the direct flight.", January 2022,Legroom: null Seat comfort: null In-flight Entertainment: null Customer service: null Value for money: null Cleanliness: null Check-in and boarding: null Food and Beverage: null
10,Where are my flight credits???,"I spoke to Milly at Qantas today and gave her my email address, my QFF number and my mobile number and I asked her to help me and promise that she wouldn't put me on hold because for the third time over the last 2 days I was put on hold and disconnected - Milly put me on hold! Guess what? She promised to call me back - she hasn't. Yesterday I was promised, by someone called Shrin, an email in one hour - that was 25 hours ago!! Yesterday I was also promised help by someone who didn't give me their name - nothing!

If Alan Joyce or any Executives or Directors of Qantas actually read any of this can I just say that it appears pretty obvious that you have a problem!! Maybe you could redirect some of the taxpayer funds that have propped you up over the last couple of years and actually get something done about customer service? Qantas has had my $2,500 plus for nearly 2 years - all I want to do is make a booking with my money using credits that you gave me but then converted to something called QantasPass - which I can't use because you have not sent me the QantasPass number and expiry date so that I can use it.

10,Company gone way downhill since the pandemic,"We have been loyal frequent flyer members with Qantas ever since we started flying. Nearly all of our flights interstate and overseas were with Qantas.

However they have shown a severe lack of customer service and customer loyalty during the pandemic. I understand that as a business they had to cut costs but to have a customer service team that takes 4 - 5 hours to answer and still have no ability or skill to solve issues takes a very low level of care from a company towards their customer base.

We flew with Qantas to Honolulu from Sydney after nearly 2 years of lockdowns. On our second day in Hawaii I received a text from them stating they were cancelling all flights to and from Honolulu going forward until the end of March. They gave us a ¡°priority¡± number to call to rebook on other airlines that they had supposedly ¡°secured¡± seats for us to go back home.

After being on hold for 30 minutes we were connected to the usual Phillipines customer service team who had no idea what we were talking about. A couple tries later and we finally got a hold of someone that knew the situation only to be told that we had choice of either going back home the next day or waiting until March !!! To top of it all off when we said that was ludicrous and we want a refund for our second leg, the customer service rep told us that because we were choosing to not take up their offer to return we will loose most of our money and get a refund of $95 dollars for a $900 dollar flight.

We now have to fly to LA and fork out the extra cost for a one way ticket back home to Sydney.

10,Loss of trust in a brand. No customer service when needed. Absolute Radio Silence,"Just to be clear, I've nothing against the great staff who work with Qantas who go out of their way to make passenger life better. I appreciate them working through this pandemic. This is purely a reflection to management to not prioritise customer service.

We booked through Qantas for our first trip post the pandemic to see the family. We were under the impression that flying with Qantas with a semblance of being in control as I presumed Qantas would be there if we needed help.

They are practically non existent in terms of if you need need help via phone, email and chat. The three things you need response if you are flying in these times and things fast changing and we needed their help.

I spent around 16 hours at this point on the phone only to get no reply from them. This is to change my flights as we contracted COVID.

I spent few more of these hours before we flew to clarify some visa rules. Except Qantas every other entity we dealt with, even immigration had some reasonable waiting periods.

Qantas has been the worst in terms of reachability.

Your contact numbers in India don't work. The office seems to be closed all the time.

The Singapore office seems to be the only one reachable from within India for 24/7 and even their waiting times are horrendous. I was able to speak to them last week after waiting for over 2-3 hours. Today even that doesn't work as well.

They have no advertised internationally reachable Australian number on the site. That's un-acceptable for a national airline.

Their 131313 number is only reachable if you have a roaming Australian number, even that has waiting times over 2 hours and I've been online for almost 3 now. Got disconnected after 3 hours in a previous try.

Lack of a 24/7 web chat or a contact us form within the `My Bookings` section in this day and age does not bode well.

If you care at all the reason I stayed on hold for 7 hours is after deducting my points and money the flight I had booked has disappeared and I cant get any assistance. I had booked first class.

During these times when the aviation and tourism sector are on its knees your going about poorly in mainting your customer base . Maybe a little less focus on how to get money off passengers and a bit more focus on how to treat your customers well might actualy make you compatiable with other international airlines such as ethiad,emirates and singapore rather than a glorified budget airlines which you have become.

10,"Qantas the 'No' Brand - No Empathy, No help, No Customer Service","My Partner had a death in the family and needed to delay his flight to attend the funeral. Emirates (operating the flight out of Italy) advised as the booking was with Qantas we should contact them and considering the circumstances Qantas should waive any cost to make the changes. My partner then called Qantas waited on hold for 45mins until his credit ran out without any resolution.

As it was difficult to reach Qantas and I was based in Australia I offered to make contact and arrange the flight changes; the initial call took 3hrs before speaking to a customer service Rep, who was helpful and provided some options which I needed to confirm with my partner once it was an appropriate time in Italy.

I called back later waited 3.5hrs to speak to someone, he then advised that there was not flight matching the details I gave (same details I gave earlier which were confirmed) and then stated that there was no details found on my partner. After battling with him to locate the flight and my partners booking he wanted to charge an additional cost for the requested change, when raising Emirates feedback was to waive the cost in such circumstances he then put me on hold for 10mins and then hung up on me sending to complete a customer survey.... Are you kidding?? Although he could see my number he didn't call back and I waited a further 2.5hrs to attempt to sough this out, we ended up going on line and paying for flight changes.

However, the lentil pasta definitely had DAIRY cheese on top. I have been vegan for 6 years and could taste it was dairy and my best friend confirmed it.

I asked if it could be done faster as I needed the money to get a new ticket, the manager promised on the phone told me they would call me back within today. They never called back. It has now been 8 weeks, and not only I had no phone call back, and my money has still not be refunded... I am now on the wait again on the phone - 1.40 minutes so far...

We were expected to wait with every other passenger and present ourselves to Border control. So you can expect 1 and 1/2 hour wait to re-enter Australia but hang on you never left the Country.

The plane was empty with about 20 people on board. We had selected exit seats which were great for legroom. The in flight catering is pathetic. A snack box with runny tomato salsa and some crackers plus a water. No wine or juice offered. You get more from Jetstar with their meal voucher.

A second printer was not working and we were sent to a check in stand that does not print out baggage receipts and after much waiting and confusion it finally was printed..All of these issues could have been prevented by careful maintenance of the machines, more staff and competent staff.

Qantas responded stating as we had ¡°accepted and confirmed the booking....and travel has been completed...we are unable to refund the points.¡± A case of ¡°take it or leave it attitude¡±.
What Qantas conveniently ignored however, was that we raised our concerns with them 27 days prior to our departure and no response was received until we had departed and our travel had practically concluded. This email was completely pointless as the horse had bolted. Had they responded before our departure in a timely manner, we could have adjusted our travel dates or cancelled the booking and sought travel with an alternative airline.

30,Qantas cancelled flights difficult to rebook,"Qantas cancelled the international flight my partner and I had booked for June 2022. We were not offered a refund. We applied for and were given a voucher on line. We tried to rebook on another flight however our voucher was not accepted as ¡°the value of the voucher is more than the cost of the new flights¡±!? We tried to upgrade to premium economy, but the voucher was still not accepted. We even tried business class, to no avail. We had also paid $280 US for seats with ¡°extra legroom¡± but could not get a refund for these online either.

I phoned a Qantas reservations, entered my Frequent Flyer number, and waited on hold for two an a half hours-no call back option was offered. I was then connected to a line with such poor reception that communication was almost impossible. Instead of attempting to sort the problem out from their end, I was given numerous almost indecipherable instructions on how to solve the problem online. After several attempts to recover our $280 US, I was disconnected. I didn¡¯t have a chance to ask how to use our vouchers to rebook our flights.

The following morning, my partner found another Qantas reservations number, one listed for Frequent Flyers. Again I was told that the wait time would be more than 2 hours but I this time I was offered a call back option. Two hours later, a Qantas agent rang me back. The line was clear, and the agent was courteous. It took almost an hour for her to rebook our flights, select our seats and organize a refund for our previous seat selections- we had to upgrade in order to get the extra legroom. The agent was patient and kept us informed at all times. At the end of the call I was asked to rate the call 1-5. I tried to enter 5 to acknowledge the help we¡¯d received, but the line went dead.

Qantas should offer all of its customers a call back option if Qantas has cancelled their flight. They alsi need to fix their online booking system so that customers have some chance of rebooking cancelled flights using Qantas vouchers and getting refunds for seat selections. To the agent who finally assisted us in successfully rebooking our flights, I say ¡°Thank You!

40,Business as usual,"Thie flight QF1748 MEL-MCY is operated by Qantaslink utilising a Boeing 717 aircraft with 12 business class seats in a 2 - 2 configuration.

The business class seat (1A) offers extra legroom with luggage having to be stored in the overhead compartment during take-off and landing.

Small tray table stored in arm of seat for use for meal service or to use for laptop or tablet.

Charging points available for phone but this aircraft has no wi-fi or Qantas inflight entertainment system so you will need to bring your own reading material or electronic device and headphones to listen to music or watch movies.

Warm greeting upon entering the aircraft. For some time now the pre departure glass of water or juice has not been offered I hope only as a result of the pandemic and that it is re-introduced at some stage.

Shortly after levelling out the lunchtime meal service commenced and on offer was a salad or toasted ham and cheese sandwich. Bread was also offered along with water, juice , a selection of still and sparkling wines.

Coffee and tea were also offered after the meal service.to consume with the Lindt chocolate ball.

The staff servicing the business customers were pleasant and without being obtrusive offered additional refreshment and drinks throughout the flight.

The Boeing 717 aircraft fleet is due to be replaced commencing 2023 with Airbus A220 and this will be welcome as the aircraft interiors are starting to look a little tired.

The only negative would have to be the meal offering as on other services there is usually the salad and an offering of vegetable pastie with sweet potato mash or chicken and vegetable pie with pea mash.

But food is important to all people. It doesnt need to be gourmet but it does need to be time appropriate, journey length appropriate and of a reasonable standard. Perhaps they are struggling financially and cant afford the extra dollar or two. Yet they keep catering to their alcohol drinkers free. Sorry to all our citizens that cant drink alcohol for religious reasons. This airline is not for you. And what happened to those delicious hot/salad boxed meals from a few years back.

The check in at Heathrow was fast and efficient, if a little cramped.

I was in 5K which is a great seat for solo travellers. Always go for the odd numbers as these are against the window and more comfortable.

One of the flights attendants was from my previous flight 2 weeks before. She provided excellent service as before but the overall crew were not as good. Some of the blokes were pretty casual and one guy just would not put his mask over his nose.

I was also a bit disappointed that they ran out of sauvignon blanc wine and crisps after about 4 hours into a 16 hour flight. Come on this is business class - don't skimp!

I was also disappointed to see that my tray table had clearly not been wiped down - covered in crumbs. So much for a COVID clean in between flights...... I don't believe any of what they say now about cleaning based on the mess I saw so I wiped everything down myself.

Time before that I was offered Thai green vegetable curry at 10.30am on a 4.5hr flight. That or an apple. Or ghastly snacks on snack flights with sugar laden savory salsa dip and bird seed cracker. So thats full service. Do Thais eat green curry that early. Crews seem fake friendly and robotic. Its just not worth the extra money.

Disregard the reviews of loyalist Aussies (I'm even an Aussie) who will blindly support anything OZ and declare it ""the best"" as this is their claimed ""national"" airline.

Forget phoning their call centre for multiple hours on hold, I've spent over 21 hours ""on hold""!!!! Don't rely on your booking, as Qantas has unilaterally cancelled and changed my flights six times and then uses its time-expired future flight credit. If you get an answer, your requested refund is promised AFTER 2 MONTHS!!!!!, and then doesn't occur. Any flight points can rarely be used as very few seats are allocated for such and, if used, expect several transit stops and long layovers to your destination as I've twice experienced.

10,"irresponsible, low quality and unbelievable terrible customer support","With 53 years old of age, I have travelled around the world for the past 35 years and i have never ever seen such a terrible customer support and un-organised Airline. This was the first time I used Qantas for my trip and i had a such a bad experience on a returned journey.
the Flight was Emirates operated by Qantas it means Qantas manages everything here.
1- My original ticket was from Melbourne to Tehran with 2.5 hours lay-over in Dubai, my ticket got cancelled and instead another ticket issued with more than 18hours lay-over. for almost 1 week i have tried to contact Qantas to ask them to provide an accommodation to me an my daughter but i was not able to hold of any one and finally one day after 5 hours on-hold some one picked up and said this is not us and i have to contact Emirates. I called emirates and they picked up the phone very quickly and their answer was this is Qantas not us. No response from Qantas what so ever,
after 18 hours we tried to check-in for the next flight but Emirates couldn't find the ticket because Qantas didn't pass the new reference number to the emirates hence they couldn't find our tickets and we were close to miss our flight. Thanks to Emirate to help us to find the new reference for the ticket.
2- On the returned Journey, from Dubai to Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne, we arrived Sydney on the 1st of December at 10:30pm and our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was scheduled at 7pm on the the 2nd of December. At 11:45pm airport security kicked us our of the airport with all the languages because of the Curfew and we had to spend hours on the street, No Qantas representative there to care bout their passengers. we had to stay outside for many hours, No communication, no access to toilets no water. this is what you expect to see in some third world countries not in Australia. We couldn't even get a hotel as we were international traveller. Qantas could email and notify us about curfew and provide us some guidance.

50,Long 17 hour leg to LHR,"This was the second sector of the flight from Sydney to London. I was in the same seat 7A which was very comfortable. Due to a thunderstorm, we were delayed for about an hour before we could start off again.

I was amazed to be served another hot meal after takeoff. I had barramundi which was delicious. I also pre-ordered breakfast which was to be served 2 hours before landing in LHR.

The seat converts to a lie flat bed with a duvet cover and a mattress. I am 6ft and was comfortable with room to spare.

The service was even better than the last flight - I think these are London based crew and they worked hard to make everyone comfortable (without the attitude sometimes displayed by Aussie crew - ie the I am really too good for this job and I am going to make you know it...).

I had seat 7A which was very comfortable and I like all the areas for storage. It is worth being in the front business cabin if you can and if you are on your own, select odd numbered seats against the window.

The food was good overall - my main dish was a little dry but everything else was tasty. I watched a couple of movies and then we were already in Darwin. You get off here for 1.5 hours in a dedicated transfer area and there is the lounge for eligible passengers.

As nothing was heard by 19 November, we telephoned and waited 3 hours on the phone before being told that we could have a refund on our credit card for the cancelled return flight (approx $ 2500) but the credit would take a further 8 weeks to process.

10,"If you value your time, Don't Fly Qantas","Note this applies to any Qantas flight .
I booked a flight in June to go to my Son's wedding, mid December.
Unfortunately Covid came along and WA (sensibly) restricted entry.
Last week (early October), Qantas emailed me advising that they had cancelled my flight. I understood the reason behind this, their business has been considerably affected by Covid and they are don't agree with the WA lock-down policy so rather than look to a further reduced operation they have cancelled all flights into WA.

That is their decision.

So my flight is cancelled with no option of other Qantas flights, but rather than refund my money, the money that they have had for 4 months, they give me a flight credit valid until 2023.
It has restrictions. I can not use it on a cheaper flight. If I use it on a more expensive flight I must pay the extra.

Thank you Qantas but really I want my money back.
If I had cancelled the flight I would have faced a penalty of $100 or so but Qantas cancelled the the flights and the get a reward of having my money for 4 months.

The only way to turn my flight credit into a refund is to call and speak to someone, despite being directed to their web site, there is no provision to even request a fefund for the flight.

I call and the Qantas answering system advises me that there is a wait time of between one hour and two hours.

I am 66 and I only have a limited of hours left in my life and I really had not planed listening to Qantas self commending themselves for 2 hours on the phone but I have no other choice if I want to get my money back from them.

I think that since Joyce became CEO they have not travelled so well and they may not be in business long enough for me to use a flight credit. I have other things to do with my money.

So after 2 hours and about 14 minutes I get through to a Qantas Customer Service person who tells me that they can hold my money until December 2023.

I tell him how they have cancelled the flight and I will now not get to my son's wedding, even if WA borders open up for double vaccinated people, and that I do not plan on travelling any where else.

So after another wait on the phone while the customer service person checks with his supervisor, I am told that my money will be credited back onto my Debit Card.

BUT it will take 8 weeks!!

So I have lent Qantas operates by taking money up front for future flights but when they refund for services they don't provide they keep that money for an additional 2 months.

I hope they stay in business long enough to process my refund.

I spent 3 hours of my life to get my refund processed.

10,We're not all in this together,"I was in the unfortunate position of being in Tasmania on 25 June and trying to get back to Qld on 26 June when there was a snap lockdown in Sydney. Flights were being cancelled and I received notification that my flight with another airline had been cancelled and I had been put on an alternate flight on another day.. I rushed to book a flight with Qantas and decided to book a full priced Business class fare at a cost of $1600 as I had to be back in Qld on the 26th and believed if there was a problem I would get priority. 15 minutes after booking this fare I received a text from the other airline saying they had rebooked me on a flight on the correct day. I therefore went online and cancelled the Qantas flight- to be advised that I would receive a credit voucher- are you kidding me. 15 mins after booking and a full fare that is supposed go be fully refundable? I couldn't get onto Qantas by phone as there were hundreds of people trying to sort out their travel so waited to the following week. When I phoned to say I wanted a refund not a credit voucher I was told I would have to apply and it would take up to 8 weeks to be processed. I advised that this seemed outrageous but was then told it probably wouldn't take that long bu they had to say that.
Well, 7 weeks later I contacted Qantas again today- was on hold for 33 minutes to be told that they had just processed my application and I would receive my refund in 7-10 business days.
This is an abuse of the vendor/customer relationship between Qantas and their customers. I was told it is taking this long as there is a back log of being wanting refunds- of course we want refunds why isn't this the default position for full fares rather than artificially creating an 8 week plus 'backlog'.
I know the tourism industry is doing it though, but exploiting your customers is not the solution. That money means whether some of us can pay our mortgages or not- Qantas is just in it for themselves.

I spoke to Qantas Hotels and they were able to change the dates for an additional $88 :-). However, Qantas being a large organisation, Qantas Hotels can't help with flights.
I then rang Qantas and after 3 attempts, 2 hours on hold got through to be told I has to pay another $744 over an above $618 I had paid, and the government contributed $618, Thus total cost for return flight, for two, to Cairns $1,980!!!!

10,What is wrong with these people!,"Diabolical customer service. I had my flights rescheduled because of COVID. Fine! I understand. Except that they rescheduled my first flight to land 9 hours after my connecting flight took off - so it was impossible to actually fly. How could a company with their level of computing, logistics and ticketing expertise not imagine and not prevent the problems that might arise if they only manage one leg of a rescheduled journey? Tried sorting it out on qantas.com and my booking just disappeared entirely. No voucher. No email to indicate that the booking had been cancelled. Nothing on qantas.com to tell me what to do next and nothing appeared after 5 days. Tried calling them but my phone battery ran out after waiting for 2 hours. Why isn't there a callback service so that they call you back when your name comes up in a queue? When I finally got through to customer service, they told me that when it gets too busy, they just switch the callback service off. This nonsense can't be blamed on the pandemic. They've had a year to sort that out and it's really not that difficult for an airline to manage two legs of a journey. There are fundamental problems with the basic competence of people who work in IT for qantas and those people need to be removed before anyone can confidently buy a ticket from them. The user interface on qantas.com simply does not deliver what its supposed to deliver.

After numerous telephone calls the bag was eventually found to still be in Brisbane. Our stop over in Brisbane was 1.5 hrs - plenty of time to get the bags sorted. The bag belonged to my wife and Qantas provided and emergency kit - all male products! NOT helpful. We were told by people on the Island that this situation is not uncommon! We got our bag 24 hours later. It will make us seriously consider whether we continue to use Qantas, even though we have a lot of flying points. We do not need the stress.", May 2021,Legroom: 50 Seat comfort: 40 In-flight Entertainment: 40 Customer service: 50 Value for money: 50 Cleanliness: 50 Check-in and boarding: 50 Food and Beverage: 50
