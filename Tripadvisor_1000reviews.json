So I had to take a morning flight. Service was good, but the table wasn't clean. So I wiped it with my antibacterial wipes. I reported to the customer care on my return, as it's not good at all. Immediately they returned a call with an apology and gave me complimentary FF points.","1":"Not even remotely interested having this morning had my Business Class seat booked August 2022 on a flight from Sydney to Cairns DOWN GRADED, yes DOWNGRADED, to economy class. Flying with Qantas used to feel like a privileged, romantic adventure. Not any more. These days flying with Qantas is a humiliating ordeal.\n\nNot surprising Qantas world airline ranking has dropped to 19 from the top ten and that Qantas was the very worthy recipient of the CHOICE organisation\u2019s 2022 Shonky Award.","2":"Flight delayed, plane old, no leg room. Hardly any service wouldn\u2019t want to be dying of thirst. Ground staff at Bangkok airport very rude.","3":"Absolutely horrible!! My suggestions are to AVOID any business with qantas.\nI booked online flight to Thessaloniki in Greece one week ago. During the online process in a favour to complete my flight reservation, I choose the journey from Thessaloniki to Sydney in a duration of 26h and 40m and proceed to complete. However, after I paid the full amount and I received the confirmation e-ticket, the inbound journey was clearly showing almost 3days trip (leaving Thessaloniki on 30.9.23 and arriving in Sydney on 2.10.23), yes 3days trip via London.\nI immediately called customer service to request a full refund, after an hour of explaining the situation (and 1h 13m) being on hold I was instructed that a refund will be less (around $250) from the ticket value, and I agree on that since I had no other choice.\nAfter 3 days, I received refund of $3,151.92 from the ticket that I paid $3,964.22 and I lost $812.30\nI removed qantas from my personal and my business list as well I instructed all my business associates to follow my action.","4":"Qantas is a absolute joke. Terrible old planes and cramped seats. Flights are always delayed. We were delayed by 2 hrs and then 4 hrs. What a joke without any compensation at all. I have told my company and they will stop flying with them from now on.","5":"I travelled to Queenstown on Business Class with a friend via a Qantas points redemption. Overall I would have to say the experience was very average and barely adequate for a 3 hr trans-Tasman flight. I was certainly glad it was a redemption, as I would have been very disappointed if I had paid the $1600 price for this flight.\n\nThe only difference between this flight and Qantas domestic class appeared to be the champagne and more (frequent) drink service. To Qantas' credit, the Jacquart Cuvee champagne was quite nice and the pumpkin salad I had was quite nice. The accompaniments (biscuits and dessert) were very basic and below the standard I am used to on Virgin domestic business service. The beef and chicken dishes offered to other passengers were not to my taste at all and looked to be quite sloppy, below the standard expected for international business.\n\nSome other points of note, firstly the check-in process was very slow. The \"priority\" queue was long and if you can use the automatic machines (for economy) it probably would have been quicker. As we were checking in skis and had a lot of bags (the main reason for travelling in business) we used the manual check-in. The process took over 20 mins. As a result of this and the long \"priority\" security line (not Qantas' fault, I know) we had very little time to spend in the lounge. The lounge time was further reduced by having to take a bus to a remote parking bay, which also meant there was no priority boarding and the flight also left and arrived late.\n\nThe food offerings in the international business lounge were similarly less extensive than what I have experienced in the past in the Air NZ lounge and Virgin domestic lounges, although still acceptable.\n\nI also felt that the business seat was more upright in its normal position than the Virgin 737 business seat, and the recline was more limited (although I couldn't find exact figures, the seat pitch is 1\" more with Virgin).\n\nQantas also forgot to load the business noise-cancelling headphones on this flight and offered a 2000 point credit as a result (which was promptly delivered without further request, to their credit).\n\nAll up, I felt that Virgin domestic business was slightly better, even with the lack of IFE, footrest and USB charging, due to the more comfortable seat (at least to me), better food, and better lounges.\n\nUnfortunately there are no wide-body flights to Queenstown but it is clear the 737 service falls very, very short of normal international business (i.e. wide-body) service. No tablecloth, the meal is presented on a single tray instead of individual plates, not even drip coffee available (instant only), and a very basic seat. Compared to trans-Tasman business I've experienced with Air NZ (old 767 and 777) and Emirates (A380) it felt more like premium economy. It's also disappointing that Qantas don't offer Wifi on international 737 flights.","6":"I had flight from Rome to Sydney with stop in Perth, the first 15 hours flight was poor in terms of customer care and quality service.\nFirstly the hostess in our sector was very rude, in 15 h she never smiled to the customers and when we asked something to her she was answering very rud. Secondly the food was ridiculous. I paid 1095 Euros to have a poor lunch, How can a flight from Rome with most of the customers on board from Italy gave Pasta that we all known how poor will be the quality... So We decided to get chicken salad and really I never had a meal worst than that, probably KFC made had better quality.\nThen you dont even provide a dinner, we had to wait till the morning after to have a ridiculous breakfast made by unknown sausages and a stuff that was meant to be scrumble eggs but really you could do better! Even China Airlines provide a better service to their customers.\nAlso we were sitting close to the engine and the noise of that motor was insane and as you try to save as much money you can, you don't even provide earplugs or the normal bag with a toothbrush and all the necessaire to made customers confortable during a 15 hours flight.\nThen once in Perth we had more than 2 hours delay and again on the flight to Sydney the meal was ridiculous.\n\nI booked your company thinking was a good and customers care company but was a sad mistake.\nDefinitelly I will never flight again with you and will try to convince more people possible to spend better their money.","7":"By far the worst flight experience I've ever had and I firmly believe this company is a scam. My luggage was lost in February and despite following all instructions that were given to me by Qantas team members , I have yet to receive a refund for my lost items.\n\nMy bag was lost on my flight and upon landing in Australia I immediatly reported it missing and received a file reference number. I was told my bag was in Dallas TX and would arrive the following day. The next day I called to check on the status of my bag and was told it was \"delayed but on its way\".\n\nMy bag never arrived for the entirety of my trip. I was told to check in at the Dallas airport during my departure home to see if my bag was there, it wasn't. I was instructed to call customer service, the agent attempted to end my call without resolution because there is \"a time limit per call\". I push back and asked for resolution. The agent told me my bag would be shipped to my home address, it never came. I reached back out and was told to fill out a claims form to receive a refund for my lost items, and that I would be receiving an email shortly providing me with a case number. I was instructed to email my claims form back to this email address. The email never came.\n\nI called customer service, after an hour of explaining the situation I was given the email address and instructed to submit my claims form with my file reference number. I got no response. I reached back out, no response.\n\nToday I spent the last hour and 8 minutes with a customer service agent who told me my file reference number doesn't exist (yet every other agent was able to use it with no issue), then put me on a \"brief hold\" which lasted 20 minutes, then the call ended abruptly with no resolution.\n\nI am at a loss of words with how disorganized this company is. I'm also extremely frustrated with having to put forth hours of my time and effort on a situation that has a very simple solution. I've been fighting for my refund since February, have spoken with over 20 Qantas staff members throughout this process and continue to get nowhere.","8":"Appalling customer service and daylight robbery. Booked with Qantas directly 3 weeks ago for an early flight only to find we were bumped due to overbooking by Qantas. Told we were on a later flight but had to pay an additional GBP 200 for the pleasure! Despite their acknowledgment of fault.\nCouldn\u2019t care less attitude when trying to resolve this.","9":"Expensive Business class. Seated 1A seat would not move. Did not seem light International aircraft maybe domestic. Crew were exceptional.\nFood was disgusting. Seat was extremely uncomfortable & no room to move.\nWill never use Qantas again after years of loyalty, I am Gold FF.\nUsing Garuda in August.","10":"I made this purchase on 28.07.2022, order number QA10656430, paid $65 in hope to contribute to the Environment care program.\n\nI was meant to get a Green Tier with all the consequent perks, but never got it. It\u2019s been almost a year, however Qantas \u2018Customer Insult Service\u2019 wouldn\u2019t even bother to do anything.\n\nBeen calling and sending emails to the customer service for a month now in vain. Every time they seem to be unaware of what\u2019s been happening and it\u2019s like something new they\u2019ve never heard before.\n\nOn top of that, they hung up on my call in the middle of the conversation or make excuses as if the phone call was breaking up.\n\nOverall, total disrespect and humiliation from this joke customer service.\n\nI assume I\u2019ve donated $65 to Qantas, they never offset any emissions and it\u2019s just the way for them to rip off the customers.","11":"My husband and I returned home from Brisbane on QF 0937 on the 26th June. Bear in mind this is a 5 hour trip.\n\nFirstly, the plane was so old and the seats so small that it is getting ridiculous. If anyone is slightly on the heavy side, it is uncomfortable for them and also for those having to sit next to them.\n\nThe aisle is so narrow that is is almost impossible for two people to pass each other especially if the plane is full, which our plane was, as they can't duck into a spare space to let the person pass. It's not OK for someone to rub themselves against you. No way!\n\nThe Customer Service Manager (Darren) in my opinion was out of line in regards to a couple of his comments.\nFirstly, he told the passengers to be polite and respectful to each other. Seriously Qantas?\nThen he told the passengers that if anyone abused the alcohol he would 'cut it off'.\nI am absolutely sick to death of 'WOKE' and he needs to be advised by management that these sort of comments are outrageous and not necessary.\n\nLastly, Qantas continues to cut it's services every time you fly.\nYou no longer get the following:\n1. The wet one to wipe your hands.\n2. The cheese and cracker biscuit\n3. The ice cream after lunch","12":"I travel regularly domestically for business and while airlines are struggling to recover from Covid. Qantas\u2019s issues go deeper than that. Under the leadership of Alan Joyce the airline has slipped from number one in the world for safety to number 17. The fleet has never been older and basic maintenance issues continue to plague departure and arrival times. The staff do need to be acknowledged for continuing under trying times to retain the high qantas professionalism. How Joyce can hold his head up is beyond me as the incoming CEO will have significant work to restore the brand","13":"If you're expecting your bags to arrive with you I would definitely not use Qantas. The whole experience from check-in to baggage collection has been average. Some staff members are lovely but by and large my experience was terrible. Won't fly with again.","14":"I have enjoyed several flights on QANTAS paying the extra for Premium Economy - choosing my seat. However, if latter (viz seating plan) is unavailable & 'they' ignore your preference I would strongly advise the additional expense ! The middle bank definitely not worth additional cost.","15":"What a show Qantas put on today. Transfer from international to domestic. How do international travellers cope. First a bus line to find you get a taxi voucher to then wait in a longer queue. Ended up getting train. Feel sorry for staff...how much profit did they make. Not happy..Qantas lift your game","16":"Still waiting for my promised refund 3 years later. Have wasted soooo much time, had my safety endangered by being turfed out of the airport in the middle of the night after the Qantas flight was delayed 7 hours (they made no provisions for us whatsoever), seat was filthy, staff were rude and unhelpful (gave me wipes so I could clean it myself), old caked on food was stuck to tray and on TV screen (had to request more wipes), were served food worse than in economy (if that's even possible, I hate to think what they got since we got partially cooked rice, mystery meat mush (mostly gristle), a cube of cheese and a stale bread roll, and... the list goes on. I need a book for the rest. Will never EVER out of principle travel with Qantas again. Even if they offer cheap flights. Most un-Australian company ever. They were at the top of their game once upon a time... so sad (if they were in dire straits I could understand but instead they are boasting about record profits. Plus they weresupported with my taxpayer dollars).","17":"1hour + delays on both to and from flights. Ipads don't work. Was my sons first time on a plane and despite picking windows seats both times they changed my seats without warning to the middle. Worst than a budget airline experience with a premium price tag. Strongly suggest virgin or Jetstar. Won't bother with qantas and before this experience I thought they were the best airline.","18":"Eh ok BUT THEY TREAT YOU LIKE WORTH LESS Babies THAT NEED TO BE TALKED TO WORD BY WORD SLOLEY IN A BABY VOICE WE ARE HUMANS TALK TO US Normally AND NOT LIKE A BABEY","19":"Qantas is THE worst airline you could ever book with - flights delayed by many hours - filthy planes \/ no customer service at all - no one cares and you\u2019ll pay $1300 for a 1.5 hour flight in economy ! A massive rip off airline snd a disgrace Shane on you qantas","20":"The thing worth noting and reviewing is the incredible treatment I received after arriving at Sydney airport after being delayed and missing my connecting flight. A single female traveller arriving late at night the staff were friendly and helpful with Zac greeting me with a smile and giving me resources to get me through (transport, accomodation and information) until my rebooked flight the following day - very grateful.","21":"Pathetic 5 hour wait at the airport late in the night to say they had a motor problems to then hear that they were so late to take off that Tokyo international airport was closed for Qantas WARNING DONT FLY WITH THEM THEY ARE THE SAME AS JETSTAR RUBBISH!! Honestly!","22":"This Qantas flight between Cairns and Uluru was operated by Alliance Airlines. It left on time (1.10pm) and arrived on time (28 June 2023). FlightRadar24 shows consistent on time performance for the past week. My recent flights on another airline 4 weeks earlier were 90 mins and 60 mins delayed, so I appreciated the on time performance. The Fokker 100, with an all economy, 2 x 3 seat configuration, is not the newest kid on the block, but it\u2019s reliable. The Alliance cabin crew were exceptional, so a big shout out to Jayden and Mosi (apologies if I\u2019ve mis-spelt your names!). Professional, engaging and clearly loving their jobs. About a 3 hour flight , with a pre-packaged ham and Bavarian mustard sandwich, or fresh fruit, served with juice, wine, tea\/coffee and water. A second round of drinks were offered after the meal service, which was appreciated - no need to use the cabin crew call button. Not much to see at 34,000 feet as the unseasonal rain and extensive cloud band covering central Australia obscured the ground view. Smooth flight, with minimal bumps as we descended through the cloud cover prior to landing at Ayers Rock Airport, so thanks to the flight crew. The Fokker 100 may be old, but it sure beats the hell out of a Dash 8 turbo-prop that Qantas uses on many of its regional routes. I\u2019d fly with Alliance Airlines anytime.","23":"We flew from Sydney to Brisbane.\n\nFlight was uneventful and we arrived ontime.\n\nCrew were friendly and a snack and drink included in the price of a ticket.","24":"I had booked and paid for 2 business class tickets in Dec 22 (using points plus pay). Boarding passes for myself and my sister were issued at luggage check-in. Upon arrival to business class lounge we were called up and told that only one of us could fly business, I requested to speak to a supervisor. I was put on to Karen (by phone). Karen gave me several reasons, all unsatisfactory but apologised and assured me that the points and funds difference would be credited to my account. She further said by way of compensation she would offer me a $500 credit for the inconvenience. I enquired if this was to be cash, she said no it was a credit to be used towards flights only.\nKaren also subsequently met me at the gate before boarding and reiterated same.\n\nI was so distressed and affected by this bad start to my special Christmas gift holiday to my sister, that I ended up having to go to the hospital in Singapore. and I was very ill for the first 2 days of our 10 day trip All of which can be evidenced. I am not seeking compensation for this aspect but it should be known so that you have a complete picture of what occurred and the knock on effect.\n\nQantas have shunted me from one department to another. First Customer Service (who apparently have no phone number), then Reservations Dept, then Frequent Flyer loyalty program. Each department tells me it is not under their purvue and that I need evidence of what Karen offered. I was told to go to the airport (a 4+ hour round trip for me) and to try to locate Karen at the airport. I explained that I would not be able to get to the business class lounge without a ticket and clearing customs - that Karen may not be working that day and that there may be many Karen's who work for qantas. I was told I should have taken a reference number for the offer made by Karen. Well I did not realise I needed to make a recording or get an affidavit from her on the day as I took her at face value, assumed (and still do believe) that she made this offer in good faith. I am now told after wasting days \/weeks on this that the complaint has been closed. I was not advised of this via email and no explanation given, they just decided to close it. Astonishing! Now when I make an enquiry I keep getting replies stating the reference number does not exist, presumably because they unilaterally decided to close it.\n\nQantas need to honour their promise and obligation. ie\n1. The correct amount of Frequent flyer loyalty points to be returned to my account (some points have been reinstated and then removed and I am querying the actual amount is correct).\n2. For the compensation amount of $500 (for use towards flights ) to be added to my account as promised.","25":"My review relates to Flight QF1043 from Broome to Sydney on 30 June 2022 & concerns the flight attendant, David Crandel (if this is his name?), in the Business Class cabin where I was seated in 1A. Let me recount in detail the unacceptable experience I suffered on your flight at the hands of this employee.\n\nI boarded this flight, which had been delayed, and sat in my allocated seat. As it happened, the woman seated next to me (I thought it was to be empty, according to the seat booking) had already taken up all the space in the overhead locker above, so the female flight attendant had to help me find some space in another locker, as I was sitting in Row 1 where no floor luggage is allowed. I will come back to this later. I note there is no priority boarding for Business Class at Broome airport, so my embarkation took a much longer time than usual when travelling Business Class (where I note, airline companies make most of their money, even domestically).\n\nThe aircraft departed and soon after (as I was seated in 1A) Mr Crandel came and asked me what meal I would prefer, the beef or chicken. I responded that I was vegetarian. He became indignant and asked me had I specifically requested a vegetarian meal. I said that this option had not been available in the online booking app where I had bought this flight ticket, but that my Qantas profile had this detail (you can check). He said, in a condescending tone, that he would see what he could do, and said that there might be an omelette available in the Economy cabin. I responded politely that that would be fine, as I am not vegan. He then asked me would I like to have a drink in the meantime, and I responded in the affirmative. He brought me a small bottle of the Grant Burge.\n\nI then waited over 35 minutes while he fed & wined the other 11 passengers in the Business Class cabin. He did not speak to me at all during this time. He went back to the galley and was pulling drawers in and out, so I got out of my seat and approached him, and again politely asked if he\u2019d had any luck in acquiring a meal for me. He appeared to be annoyed, and said he\u2019s been very busy and that he hadn\u2019t had time to chase up my particular needs. I asked him for his name and he refused to provide it and he appeared to have no name tag. I told him he\u2019d only provided alcohol for me, at which point he grabbed the half empty bottle of Grant Burgeons from my tray. I then said that I\u2019d paid over $2000 for this flight, and that angry mood further escalated and he shouted at me that I was bullying him and he would call the Federal Police and have me escorted off the plane and charged. when I asked (facetiously) what I would be charged with? He said bullying him. I repeated, that in fact he was bullying me and at fault with depriving me of a meal and only plying me with alcohol and that he would be reprimanded for wasting the time of the Federal Police. He then became extremely aggressive and ordered me back to my seat. I then said I wanted to speak to the Captain to First Officer, at which point he shouted, \u201cThey won\u2019t see you!\u201d and again threatened me with calling the Federal Police.\n\nAt this point in the commotion, another flight attendant appeared, \u201cLibby\u201d - I think the senior flight attendant from the Economy Cabin. She told me his name, after I asked her repeatedly, and she asked him to provide me with a chicken meal so I could pick off the chicken and eat the vegetables, and the cheese etc., which he begrudgingly did. Libby brought me a glass of Chardonnay and tried her best to calm the situation, but said she did not want to get involved or give me her surname.\n\nComing in to land, after the seat belt sign came on, Mr Crandel did not take my bags on the floor at my feet, which I thought was mandatory in Row 1 when landing? WHS?\n\nThe whole experience of encountering such a rude and unbalanced flight attendant as Mr Crandel, was completely unacceptable. I have written multiple emails to Qantas without ever receiving a response to my complaint","26":"Terrible food . No games no music selection on entertainment .not all passengers watch movies. Me and my wife always listen to music on our flights.i don't think it is that hard to include it.","27":"This was one of the best long haul flights I have had.\nThe crew were attentive and fun.\nNothing was a bother, even though there were many babies.\nI think I slept better because the whole feeling in the plane was relaxed.\nWell done team.","28":"Qantas completely messed up my family holiday by cancelling my entire booking not once but twice. No explanation, no apology. Just sent me around in circles. Loss of over 400,000 points on accommodation that they won't refund. They just ignore customer complaints.","29":"I recently flew to London from Australia and spent time deciding the best option, as it happens I booked from Whyalla to Adelaide then to Perth then direct to London. Of course within a few weeks of booking (back in February) my itinerary was changed. Turns out I had to book the Whyalla to Adelaide with another carrier for $150 whilst my dear friends at Qantas offered me a \"refund\"of $62 since reduced to $54. Qantas cancelled the connecting flight\nI rang on four occasions before I left to chase my money and each time I rang I got a different answer.The last time Qantas said you have to complete all the flights (which included Zurich back to Australia) before you can get a refund. So I get home and 10 days after the refund had supposedly gone through low and behold still no money, isn't that a surprise. To add insult to injury when you ring Qantas a recorded message comes on to say 90% of refunds are put through within a week. Pull the other one they must think we all came down with the last shower.\nWhat does make you wonder is the time taken to take the money off you online when you make a booking is about 30 seconds but not quite the same the other way. It is high time some legal body investigated these deplorable actions.","30":"The overall Qantas business product is not where it previously was. Having taken the same flight down with Virgin Business it is interesting comparing the two products, Virgin was overall a better product.\nQantas check in, at Canberra (CBR) could not even see dedicated business check in and used the general boarding machines. Qantas lounge is comfortable but no dedicated business lounge in CBR just one shared with Qantas Club. At time of boarding, they just called the flight so no priority for business or premium FF members. On the plane we were only offered water prior to the flight. The plane was comfortable, and the seating was good. The meal was good overall, but we were not offered any re-fills or a second beverage. Basically, the attendant seemed to be looking at herself in her phone screen over providing service. Following service my empty water bottle and napkin clearly was visible in the front seat pocked but was never cleaned up, even though there was plenty of time on completion of the lunch service. Finally, the bags well again no business priority, the bag came out amongst all the general baggage. Being a premium FF, the premium baggage service has been nonexistent since Qantas moved to contractors.","31":"Due to COVID-19 booking was credited in Qantas Pass, some of that credit was used when booked for one way flight from Gold Coast to Sydney Qantas booking reference is 6Z55B2. Due to the queue at the counter, I was 3min late at Gold Coast Airport for baggage tag as the check in was already done. I was told that the system has been closed and they cannot serve me and I have to book for another flight. I had to look for another flight somewhere else as the rate was high in Qantas. I travelled with my family including 16months baby and had to stay for 3hrs plus to wait for the flight. This is affected me extremely mentally and financially since covid-19. Another extreme unhappy experience.","32":"So, Jetstar cancelled our booked flight, but after some slight issues got us on to this flight. Yay, we thought. We were homeward bound. Not without some chaos. First, the flight was delayed for 20 minutes. Fine, no big deal. Then, it was delayed another 20 minutes which was slightly irritating, especially since there was no explanations\/apologies\/staff to contact until the pilot made an announcement after take-off. But, then they changed the gate at the last minute and made all passengers travel to the other side of the terminal. They then announced on the plane that the catering on-board was limited in order to prevent further delays - I appreciate this is a no-win situation and passengers will be unhappy whatever happens, but this just seemed like the cherry on top.\n\nThe crew was kind enough and did their best with the hand that we were dealt, but was still not pleasant. A lot of disgruntled and tired passengers. Oh, and we paid for extra legroom seats with Jetstar, and weren't able to get them on Qantas. Understandable, but still another irritation. Have submitted a refund request and will see how that goes (Ha! I think we all know what to expect of Jetstar, frankly)","33":"My mom was ment to fly back to SA on the 24th of June. The original flight from Sydney to Johannesburg was delayed by 7hours. This was after she had a 14-hour layover because Sydney airport does not stay open at night. The flight was then canceled a few hours before the flight. They rebooked it for the NEXT DAY (26th of June) AT 22:00PM. She had to be there for 48hours! If they managed it properly and made the cancelations earlier then my mom would have been able to spend 2 extra days with us. They have no proper communication. No transparency and we wont be flying with Qantas ever again. I wont recommend them anymore to friends or family.","34":"We spent almost 2 hours in the First Class Qantas lounge at LAX, and it was wonderful.\nThe service and the food were all great and the relaxed atmosphere was awesome.","35":"It has been a very tough few years for the airline industry and I am an a avid traveller and decided to try the Perth to London direct route on Qantas. Qantas has been getting a bad rap lately so I thought I would share what a great experience I encountered. Service from checkin to onboard was excellent. The flight attendents we had were happy and always willing to help. The food and drinks were of an excellent standard as was the entertainment. Would I fly them again? Absolutely. Their safety standard speaks for itself. I love Qantas and as a proud Australian its like being at home when you step onboard!","36":"It is a long time since I have given Qantas 5 stars but in this case it was deserved. The flight left early and landed early. We got a hot panini and a wine on board. The flight had free Wifi. The baggage came off fast in Hobart. The on board staff are average as is often the case with Qantas but this was a great flight.","37":"Read the small print for all refund\/cancellation policies. Said I could get a full refund in quantas credit for my flights of $3050. I took this option as the new flights I wanted to book were $2271. However, when you use your credit, it forces you to book flights at a DIFFERENT price to the normal price advertised. It ended up charging me an EXTRA $550. So Auckland to Sydney return total of $3600, when the normal online price was $2271. This was not obvious to me when I chose qantas credit and is obviously in the small print. Will never fly Qantas again.","38":"Qantas are not good at helping any families with any issues and have the worst customer service\nSo many other airlines have much better service","39":"5hrs 20 min no screens\nPacked in like sardines\nByo entertainment\nThis airlines a joke\n.\nPaid over $600 qantas club, have over 1 million ff points. Q club is rubbish\nAirline is rubbish.\nOld stock\nOld flight attendants\nOutdated.\nThese aircraft are best suited to 1.5 hr east coast jaunts not 4 and 5 hr journeys","40":"A disaster.\nThe boarding gate at Christchurch opened late. Boarding was therefore chaotic.\nWhen all were onboard the flight was then awaiting a de-icing machine.\nWhen the Qantas de-icer arrived it did not work.\nThen another hour sitting waiting for an Air NZ de-icer.\nEventually took off over 2 hours late.\nArrived in Sydney and no available gate to disembark and so sat on the runway for more delay.\nNo assistance on disembarking. Had to go through security screening. Bit silly that as had just come off of a Qantas International flight.\nIncoming international flight security screening took ages with (once again) only one scanner working.\nAfter screening found that the flight was gone.\nNearby international transit desk closed.\nA major task to find the only open transit desk which was on the other side of the terminal - with no signage.\nAt transit desk only one person working - with a queue of 20+ waiting. (Poor employee. Felt sorry for her with no attempt by Qantas to help).\nEventually told I was re-routed via Tokyo.\nArrived Bkk 14 hours late.\nNO baggage at airport.\nMore lost time reporting lost baggage.\n\nSo, overall, a really very, very, very, bad experience with Qantas.","41":"Disappointed and waiting for a solution over 6-8 months. Been waiting so long for Qantas to sort out my membership issues, lost flight points and compensation for being stuck in the airport for 30 hrs. - SR8315442","42":"I was on a flight from port hedland to sydney, the tray table on board was stained of someones coffee and the seat was pretty old onboard the Boeing 737. However this was annoying and gross the crew where alright there was one of them that was grumpy but I will give qantas another chance.","43":"Shortly before our flight from Sydney to Darwin, I completed my check in process and had the e-tickets issued and added to my wallet. Within half an hour, I was contacted by Qantas Customer Service, advising me that they had \u201clost their business class cabin\u201d for that flight.\nI asked where had it gone? Many frustrated phone calls later, and with the help of our terrific travel agent, it turned out that after initially offering only ONE of our TWO tickets back in business class. & the other \u201cperhaps\u201d in Economy, by Qantas, that our travel agent was able to find several business class seats still available for the same flight!!\nWhat a debacle! And it left us wondering why bother with paying more, if that\u2019s how Qantas treats \u201cvalued\u201d customers!!\nThank goodness our travel agent persevered for us!\nWithout her, who knows when we could have sorted this administrative MESS!!","44":"Qantas has gone hill imo. The seats are cramped, not enough overhead space and the online \"entertainment\" i use the term lightly, was abysmal and i had no sound as my seats' earphone connection was damaged. The flight attendants were awesome however and the meals, I felt were quite nice. I will not travel economy with them again, but you have to book business class pretty quickly though as there is only limited seats and even if they were not the greatest Business Class, I have seen they would have been a def improvment. Qantas, need to not jam people in a small aircraft, if you are doing a 3 hour plus flight, you have the right to a somewhat basic level of comfort, ?No. You, will be on my \"least favourite\" flight company.","45":"The flight over was a very pleasant and a full flight. However in all my travels I have never experienced a flight attendant telling me that I was not allowed to exercise at the back of the plane. This is only for crew. On a 9 hour flight I need to stretch","46":"Looking at the past reviews... ...how on earth could Qantas be rated higher than a 3. I guess if you land at your destination they have achieved their primary purpose. But if the plane is late to board, late to take off, late to land, and U write this now because I have ample time because it has been 40min since landing and the PA announcement has just said the baggage handlers are approaching the plane to unload.\n\nI guess every dollar counts, even at customer expense (I will miss appointments now), but no tears allowed in the future when they fall (most likely begging for tax payer assistance)","47":"Booking the tickets was fine, its getting them to issue the eticket that was a problem. Contacting customer service to resolve the issues was also bad. It took them over 3 months to send me my eticket and even then my connecting flight was changed by them without informing me. Spend another week calling them non stop to fix the problem. I won't go in full details as if you look up other travel forums they are well documented. This is the result of qantas outsourcing to call centres in South Africa, Philippines or India where they just follow the script and are very rude.\nThe ground staff at Sydney airport where just plain rude, aggressive and lazy. The complimentary bus transfer that qantas operate for its customers to travel between T1 and T3 was chaotic. The two male staff where too busy talking or playing with their phones. So when the bus arrives its a mad scramble for everyone to push in line and get on board. On the return trip back I was put onto a later connecting flight even though the flight wasn't departing for another hour by the time I got to the gate. Only found this out when I was at the international to domestic connection counter that I found this out. Furthermore a specific staff (attached photo) who was guiding the waiting line on that morning was extremely rude, not helpful and was brushing people off so she can continue talking to her colleague. I have already logged a complaint to qantas (including her name and the time and date she was stationed) about her but never receive a reply back. I received friendly and helpful interaction from the staff at westjet when flying internally in Canada then the staff at qantas and yet qantas is supposedly the better airline?\nOnboard the flight, I was not expecting anything good or special. The meals was cold and serving was small. The cabin was dirty. More signs of qantas maximise profits at all cost.","48":"The flight home was wonderful.\nAircraft great. Staff very friendly and professional very attentive.\nThe food was excellent (breakfast)\nThe drinks were really good and plentiful.\nSeating well above expectations.\nWell done Qantas. Many thanks.","49":"The final leg of my journey home after a trip overseas. The aircraft was clean, comfortable and on the seats contained the standard small pillow, blanket and headphones. The seats were comfortable enough and leg room was okay. The flight was on time and landed in Sydney on time as well. The food was okay with plenty of drinks on offer.","50":"My sister and I had flown to visit our sister who resides north of Sydney. The flight home was on a Qantas Aerobus, surely the largest planes I have ever flown on. We opted for Premium Economy, one step up from economy and worth every penny. Blankets and pillows, noise cancelling headphone, excellent movies, wonderful food and complimentary wine. The staff were excellent and any request or need taken care of right away. A long flight but fairly comfortable. I wish Qantas operated all of the USA travel! We had assistance in getting through the airport and to the boarding gate. It was a long process and I would recommend arriving to do this 3 hours before boarding. We had 2 1\/2 and just made it to the gate with maybe 15 minutes to spare. Thank you Qantas for taking care of us!!!","51":"I had a pretty enjoyable trip from Singapore to Melbourne. However, the experience that Qantas offers does not seem to be consistent. The trip from Sydney to Singapore was a letdown.\n\n1. The crew members need to be more attentive. We were among the last rows being served the meal. While we could understand that sometimes certain food would not longer be available in the cart, it would not be acceptable when the passenger was handed the meal was given without any cutlery and was told to wait for the bread to come. Of course, it ended up the crew member forgot after it after almost a 10-minute wait. In addition, no one responded after the 'assistance' button was pressed. We had to catch the attention of a crew member who happened to be attending to another passenger. and that was another 5-minute wait.\n\n2. Safety - Lack of vigilance: The overhead compartment above my seat was fully packed. When a passenger took her bag out to unpack, she did not close the cover of the compartment. It was more than 5 minutes of the flight time. This could be very dangerous, especially for the passengers who sat below or near the compartment. HOWEVER, none of the crew members went around to look out for such.\n\n3. It was a A380 plane with double decks. The 'hidden' passage way for the crew members were situation besides the toilets. While we understand the crew members need to access this area, there were occasional crowds around that area. This could be done more quietly and with more consideration of passengers seated around.\n\nProfessionalism of the crew and standards could definitely be better.","52":"Bought seats for my wife and me 3-4 months in advance. Did NOT purchase through discount web site, but on Qantas web site. Economy seats were roughly $1,500 each. Was not allowed to select seats at the time of purchase, but figured I could do so for a fee later, although their web site says that seat selection is complimentary.\n\nAs is often the case, time got away from me and I didn't deal with it until a few days before departure. Couldn't do so either on their app or online. I even had signed up for their frequent flyer program.\n\nChecked in online and then saw that our seats were both center seats and quite a few rows apart. My wife and I are 66 years old and I typically will pay up to $200\/seat to get exit row or bulk head on an international flight.\n\nAt least at the airport the Qantas clerk got us together, but neither seat was aisle as we requested. The guy on the aisle must have slept 8 of the 15.5 hours of the flight, and we both ended up climbing over him by stepping on the arm rests...two 66 year olds, lol!\n\nAnyway, suffice it to say I will never fly Qantas again!","53":"I\u2019m disappointed with #Qantas after both my flights to and from Exmouth were delayed by 5hrs.\n\nDespite the flights being 10 days apart it appears as though there have been mechanical faults with the plane both times, necessitating both a plane swap and crew swap.\n\nNor does this appear to be a one off, as another passenger on this flight stated his plane from Perth to Exmouth 5 days ago also had a mechanical failure and long delay.\n\nOne failure would be a coincidence. Two seems problematic. Three in 10 days appears to be a pattern.\n\nNot only that but there is minimal support and facilities at Learmonth airport - difficult when you are travelling with a two year old and Qantas only communicates the delay late (when you\u2019re already at the airport)","54":"I would like thank the customer service of Qantas for assisting my grandma until her flight back home. Much appreciated.","55":"i travelled frm india to melbourne..the flight was normal and i requested for the wheel chair at melbourne airport as i had undergone the leg surgery . as soon as i reached melbourne i asked them to help me with wheel chair but the staff was soo rude to me.the man was some indian sikh . he spoke sooo rudely tht i feel like i should help me out myself . i am not satisfied with this airline .","56":"Flew economy to london. As a 6ft 5 guy i try to get an extra legroom seat. Managed to get one the day before flying when checking in. Free of charge. Get to the airport and they bumped me to a middle row seat because they decided to sell the seat. I wasnt even given the option to pay or i would have. Poor from Qantas but i get thats why the name isnt what it used to be. Will be flying Emirates or Qatar in the future. The Direct flight isnt what its all cracked up to be, more space on the 380 in economy. I couldnt even reach down and touch my toes without hitting the seat infront.","57":"With no knowledge Qantas flew international CHC to Melbourne then pushed me onto a domestic flight to Sydney - took five hours to negotiate then nearly missing international connection to London.\nNo apology and Qantas doesn't even reply to query except take it up with insurance\nQantas don't care","58":"No Service\nNo Gluten Free Food as requested\nNo Smiles\nNo baggage service\nNo cabin space\nNo hopeful ground crew","59":"Whilst management and the Shareholder's make a pretty penny, the people who got them there are treated to tired, dirty planes.\nThe sandwich on offer was disgusting and I couldn't believe there was no tea or coffee served?? Qantas likes to brag about an all inclusive experience, however I would rather pay for a better meal. Also tried to change a flight coming back and they were going to charge more one way than we paid for a return flight??!! We ended up cancelling the flight altogether and had a great flight back with Virgin.\nThe Qantas Lounge is disappointing - they didn't even offer fruit and the pickings were slim. What has happened to this airline? Only good thing about them is the staff on board the flight.","60":"since covud i have travelled with Qantas 4 time twice flights have been delayed.\neveryone complains about jetsatr etc.always being delayed i have also traveled with jetstar twice and both times on time.\nWhy do we pay extra for qantas no longer in flight entertainment.Unless you want to watch on phone.Pay more and get the same as everyone else.\nI will be carefully considering who i fly with next time.","61":"We booked a return family flights to Europe 10 months in advance to get a good price and availability. Later, a flight was cancelled so I called Qantas to rebook.\nBut behind the scenes something was wrong with the new booking. I don't know if it was a staff error or technical error, but the new booking only existed in one of their systems but not another. I had a feeling something was wrong because I couldn't see the booking when I logged into the Qantas online portal. Over several months I called Qantas about 10 times and spent over 100 hours on hold waiting for customer service as I tried to make sure our booking was valid. Each time, I was assured that the booking was fine. The customer service agent would re-send the itinerary to put me at ease.\nThe day before our flight, I called again because I couldn't complete online check-in or book a meal online. Again, I was assured the booking was fine and I should sort it out at the airport. But I called again and kept asking questions until eventually at 2am the staff member looked in a different system and found that my booking didn't exist.\nI asked for alternative flights but nothing was available to anywhere in southern Europe for a week or so. This wasn't an option for us since we needed to arrive on time for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday.\nQantas offered no alternative apart from a few thousand points as compensation for these mistakes with their systems.\nWe ended up booking the last available seats with Thai Airways. Actually, I found this flight to be very comfortable. The food was good, staff were kind, and the change in Bangkok worked well.\nI'll avoid Qantas any chance I get. Thai and many other alternatives are a better choice.","62":"Qantas' business class is very poor. The armchair that turns into a bed is old. The in-flight service is poor and inappropriate. The food served on board on a 14-hour flight is economy class food. Not worth it. Not worth the money spent. Hope never to fly again with Qantas. Wake-up!!!","63":"My second-ever flight on QF2 from London to Sydney (via refueling stop in Singapore) was operated by an Airbus A380. The last one was in 2019. This was a night flight so most of the time was spent sleeping and in and out of movies. Service from the FAs was good especially during sleep time as I was able to request water and promptly received my request. The best service was from the check-in clerk at Heathrow who was quick to give me an aisle seat when I asked. He also informed me that I need not worry too much as the seat next to me would be empty all the way to Sydney. Great and friendly service.","64":"I was unfortunate enough to suffer a nose bleed on my recent flight. The cabin crew were so unkind, and unhelpful. To the point that they ignored my calls for help when the bleeding was intense (they switched off the little blue call light twice!).\nWaiting for the medical team to collect me at the airport, the head steward actually stopped near my seat to perform some task, and didn't so much as look at me or ask how I was doing. This crew is a disgrace, and if this is the Spirit of Australia, I feel sorry for its citizens.","65":"I would like to thank Philip Green for his impeccable customer service. He was professional, polite and very understanding and a pleasure to deal with. Qantas you need more people like Philip. Made our check-in process and absolute breeze and made us feel so at ease. Thank you Philip.","66":"Great check-in experience, beautiful lounge and food. Gate area was orderly. The plane was obviously an older 737 but it was well-appointed in First Class. Service was prompt and friendly. We were pleasantly surprised overall and would recommend them highly.","67":"My partner and I flew qantas business class and whilst not bad there is definitely room for improvement. Seat\/bed was fine, food good, entertainment good and service acceptable. However, beverages were disappointing, only one white wine, 2 reds, of which one(shiraz) ran out. How does that happen on an Australian international business class airline? It smacked of cheapness. Overall, you'll have noticed that nothing was very good or even excellent. I flew Swiss business class on the same trip and they were far better. What has happened at qantas?","68":"I\u2019ve had a couple of bad flights with other airlines previously, and can be picky, but I had to write a review after my flight to Hong Kong a few days prior, where I received excellent customer service and was taken care of very well.\nThe air hostess Michelle was great, her safety demo was very informative as well.\nExcellent service = happy customer, I will be returning and hopefully on Michelle\u2019s flight again.","69":"I recently made my first overseas trip post Covid.\nI made in total 9 flights. 2 were with Qantas and 2 were code share with Emirates.\nI was seriously shocked at the dismal and contemptuous standard of the food and beverage service on Qantas. You are served only a tiny plate of mushy hot food with a tiny roll and a dry piece of generic cake. This is the standard of NSW rail.... not a compliment.\nEmirates has continued with the traditional full tray of airline food and repeat beverage service. On a long flight meal service is one of the things that passes the time. To be served something more suitable to a short domestic flight was a shock.\nI suppose the idea is to encourage passengers to book premium or business. For me I will just book another airline.\nI really hate to be treated like dirt.\nThe inflight entertainment service was glitchy. My screen kept freezing and would and the touch screen often would not respond. The cabin crew tried to help by rebooting. No difference. Others around me had the same problem so this must be a system issue. It was impossible to select and watch a movie. Fortunately I had brought a book. Again Emirates were vastly better.\nI left the flights both ways just seething.\nNever again unless there is no alternative.","70":"I booked a flight at the beginning of the month. A trip I\u2019ve been waiting to make for decades to visit family and was finally able to do so.\nAfter I made my booking, I realized I needed to make a slight change to my itinerary. I called Qantas and they suggested I rebook and that my first booking would be cancelled and I would not be charged.\nI did as advised and all seemed well.\nA few days later, I looked at my bank account, which I do most mornings, and throughout the day, because I live paycheck to paycheck and saw my account was overdrawn by almost $5,000. I quickly saw what had happened : I was charged for my original flight that was cancelled and that I was told I wouldn\u2019t be charged for by Qantas and also for my new booking.\nI called Qantas immediately and proceeded to spend the next 4 hours on the phone talking with different Customer Service works and hearing something different from each person.\nThe last person I spoke with actually gave me a case number and told me the refund would be proceeded in 3-5 days.\nThat night, I received an email from Qantas saying my refund was being processed and it usually to 6-8 weeks.\nMy account is still overdrawn and my savings account is now frozen. I\u2019ve been calling the BBB and the FAA and emailing any email I can find for Qantas. No money and no response.\nI\u2019m unable to pay my bills right now and I\u2019m getting no help from Qantas despite this being completely their fault.\nI haven\u2019t even flown with them and already I have a very negative view of the company.\nI\u2019d advise anyone against supporting a company that won\u2019t do whatever they can to right a wrong they created.\nReally disappointing to say the least.\nTotally at a loss for what more I can do.","71":"Check-in kiosks require a smartphone to scan a QR code for checking-in. What if my phone runs out of battery. There is no Qantas staff around to help out. Please note that not everyone has a smartphone.","72":"This was the last sector on an international itinerary. We were delayed in Sydney and ended up in transit for 6 hours instead of 4 hours. The lounge is very average with grotty showers and toilets. Time for a refurb. The international bus transfer is also very average. The flight was late yet again. Qantas planes are also tatty and this was no exception. At least the inflight wifi passes the time. I am not impressed.","73":"It is great that Qantas fly from Haneda - so much more convenient than Narita. We used the Sakura Lounge in terminal 3 as Qantas Gold. Ok lounge but nothing special. The plane was packed. The seats are showing their age. Old and shabby. Toilets are dirty and not cleaned during the flight. The usual I don\u2019t care attitude from Qantas flight attendants. Food ok. Didn\u2019t watch movies as tired. We arrived early and bags came off fast. Time for Qantas to refresh the fleet. And get some new enthusiasm from staff. Really tired Product. Even with gold membership, I am rethinking who I fly with.","74":"In the taxi to Perth airport we received a message to say that our 1050am flight was cancelled and Qantas put us on a later flight that would have got us to Sydney tooooo late for our connecting flight to Honolulu. I went into panic mode and went straight to the service desk tosee if anyrthing could be done. The lady was very helpful and after about 10 minutes she put us on standby for an erlier flight( no guarantee that we would get on) Fortunately we got seats on the 1005am flight and made it to Sydney to get our connecting flight. It pays to get to the airport early otherwise we could have not got to our destination on time. Thanks Qantas you were great..","75":"Flew Sydney to Seoul (Incheon) return QF87 and QF88 on this route re-introduced in late 2022.\n\nThe A330 business class cabin layout provides good privacy on the even numbered window seats with a little less privacy on the odd numbered window seats.\n\nFull lay flat bed with comfortable mattress and pillow and blanket. Pyjamas and amenity bags provided however you may need to ask for pyjamas if you would like them on the outgoing sector as this is a day flight.\n\nAfter leaving the Qantas International Lounge boarding is generally quick if you board during the priority boarding prior to general boarding commencing.\n\nGreeted as I entered the aircraft and shortly after you take your seat you are again greeted by the cabin crew and a pre-departure drink is offered.\n\nThe crew are very friendly and still maintain a professional but relaxed service.\n\nMeal orders were taken with some of the more popular (seared snapper dish) being unavailable by the time my order was taken in row 4 however the other options of which I chose Bannockburn chicken that was enjoyable.\n\nA nice choice of wines, spirits , soft drinks juice and water to compliment the meals and snacks provided throughout the flight.\n\nDinner service was offered later in the flight prior to arrival into Seoul.\n\nThe inflight entertainment screen is a good size and offers plenty of movies , television programs, music Podcasts throughout the over 10hr flight.\n\nSarah , Marie , Louise and Travis were the flight crew attending to the business cabin on QF87 with Travis coming through the cabin shortly before landing to thank passengers for their business and ensuring that the service received was excellent.\n\nExcellent start and finish to holiday in Seoul flying Qantas business class and look forward to further flights.","76":"Been in and out of the country for the last 3 months.\nEverytime qantas is Late. At least 3 hours. Causing me to miss other connecting flights.\nOnce 2 weeks ago travelling to Sydney from Brisbane then Manila.\nFlights from Brisbane was 3 hours late. Off course when I got to Sydney I lost the Manila flight.\nThe rude lady at the desk said they would not provide a hotel because wasn't their fault..(who's fault was it then)\nThen they flew me to Bali then to Manila. So I arrived 12 hours late.\nThe point is if you don't care about arriving on time..EVER!!!!\nThen go with qantas. But if you have business meetings, important things to attend.\nSTAY AWAY FROM qantas. They are cutting costs in a way that the airline is suffering. And the customer service is a joke, rude.\nWould love to see this company disapear","77":"I get so used to grumbling about Qantas these days that it is nice to write a good review. This is a new service non-stop to Seoul operated by the A330. The plane was not full so I had 2 empty seats next to me. The food was a highlight - 2 hot meals were served with choices and nice wines. The service was also friendly and polite - I must say the non-Anglo background staff are much nicer than the whites. The entertainment was good as well.\n\nMy only issue is the filthy toilets. Many other carriers check the toilets often and clean them through out the flight. Qantas do not.\n\nAlso, why not greet your Golds as well as the Platinums. I fly a lot with you too!","78":"I was supposed to fly to Fiji from Canberra this month for business but was informed by a Qantas message that my flight would be delayed the next day. Then another text confirming another 2 delays before I was then rerouted to Melbourne instead of Sydney and take the international connection from there. Not complaining about that but just the inconvenience of that. The same happened for my connection back to Canberra - another delay at Brisbane but pilots made up for it with a nice apology. I am not one to fret about delays as I understand the many behind the flights activities that are happening, but would be great if Qantas can help to minimise this or address these challenges so as to provide a hassle free, stress free flight. As a QF member, I choose to fly Qantas for many reason but especially so for the points etc - so Qantas, please keep improving your service. You still my number 1 choice for flights though :)","79":"Something is very broken at Qantas. We pay premium fare money for poor service. I can get the same flight for $64 with other airlines. Two people return over $1000.\n\nBoarded, all good tarmac out, on the run way, did not even get to full power and drove down the runway to go to service bay. Should be ok after engineers check it out. Thirty minutes later off loaded and had to walk from gate 28 to gate 6, Change planes. Meant to arrive in Hobart approx 1630. Arrived about 1900.\n\nCabin staff were excellent. Pilot could not apologise often enough but that doesn't solve the root issues.\n\nThe snack are revolting. Bring back cheese and bickies.\n\nNo alcohol before 1600. Some of us have been up all night and just want to relax.\n\nMy history last few flight.\n\nMelb - Cairns.\n3 attempts at take off. Change planes. No meal, limited service in contradiction to T& C's Arrived very late.\n\nMelb - Hobart Return\n4 Hour delay departure Melb arrived in Hobart after midnight. Hotel closed.\nShould have been offered Qantas Club (as happened in Singapore before.) but nothing.\nWent to service desk late and asked why not? They offered me a voucher but all cafes shut. Not lunch no tea,\n3 hour delay departure Hobart.\n\nMelb - Bne\nMy luggage went to Adelaide, I was going to Bne.. My vessel was meant to sail but luggage late.\n\nPaying top dollar for rubbish. Melb Hobart planes old, no entertainment. Poor\n\nHope the new boss can do better than Alan.","80":"Tried to get a few answers for questions we had about connecting flights but after 3 calls to 3 confused phone operators we just booked Cathay Pacifoc instead. To much hassle please train your people properly as it really should be that hard.","81":"Qantas was disappointing. It is considered a top airline, but my first experience with them on a Brisbane to Los Angeles trip was underwhelming.\n\nThe plane was old and lacked adapters for charging devices, with only one USB port. Additionally, the entertainment options were limited.\n\nWhen requesting a drink, the crew would often bring just a can without a cup or ice, which was inconvenient.\n\nThe dinner consisted of lamb with mashed potatoes, but the meat was chewy and the taste was unpleasant. The meal lacked accompanying items like bread, butter, salad, or dessert. For breakfast, served an hour before landing, the crew informed the last three rows that hot meals had run out, offering only granola and yogurt instead. This was surprising and not ideal, as I have never encountered a complete shortage of meals on a flight before.\n\nConsidering the extra cost I paid for Qantas and my expectation of excellent customer service, I found their performance to be subpar compared to other airlines I have flown with.","82":"This was a typical Qantas domestic flight - got us there but nothing special. I am so over the corn chips and salsa snack. Enough already!\n\nBaggage was distributed over 2 different carousels causing confusion in Sydney.\n\nA very average airline these days with a tatty old plane with no WiFi working.","83":"This was the last leg of a roundtrip to Samoa where we had used points. We flew domestically from Sydney to Hobart via MEL. The first flight was delayed but we made our connection. The in flight service was fine with a nice meal and good service. But when we got to Hobart no bags... a few others were in the same situation. There was no-one to help. Yep Hobart is not a huge place, but this is a capital city airport with multiple QF flights a day. The bag conveyor just stopped and nothing. We had to walk up to the counter area and scan a QR code to lodge our own baggage claim. This process gives you a number to call which I tried to do the next day as I needed to know where the bags were as I was due to leave for another trip 2 days later... I called 10 times over 2 hours and no answer or way to leave a message. In the end, I had to call the airport authority to ask them to pass a message to Qantas baggage. Then I got the good news that the bags had been found and both had flown in the next morning. A courier was despatched and arrived at my house at 2pm with ONE bag. Where is the other one??? The courier had on idea. Two hours later, the second bag was delivered by the same courier. The tags show that both bags came in on the SAME flight. Qantas are incompetent. Such poor service for anyone - let alone a gold frequent flyer travelling business class. Shocking penny pinching.","84":"Paid over $22k for 2 business seats on QF1 and QF2 to UK. Before Singapore the entertainment system failed. No entertainment on 14 hour leg to London. No call button and seat won't move all the time they kept restarting system. Got our connection to Madrid as did one of the qantas crew. Our luggage did not make it. I could add more.\n\nQantas empathy 3 x emails with 10.000 points. Not even a call.\n\nBe a shareholder not a passenger. They only care about profits and bonuses.","85":"Flight was delayed by 50 minutes, however, the crew had us delivered to Jakarta on time. The flight was okay, as was the service. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing remarkable either. Just an efficient service to get people to a destination.","86":"My friends and I were booking flights to Perth. We had booked a one-way flight for $350 and the next\nday we saw a Qantas deal for $175 each way if you were paying return. My friend called Qantas if we could cancel that flight and book under the deal. They said we will give you a credit for your flight and you can book the deal with the credit but we had to do it online. We attempted to do so and it said we would have to call to apply for the credit. The next person we spoke to said no you can't use the credit for this. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls of multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer. My return flight became a separate booking as I was returning to Adelaide a day sooner so I had to call separately. At one point I had agreed to pay a gap of $40 to change the flights and asked to confirm that I would not be charged a full new fair they said yes only $40 and then hung up on me and proceeded to take $350 out of my bank account with no permission and eventually refunded to me. They then said they would honour it after multiple phone calls from multiple employees telling us very different things and never being able to get a straight answer.\nWe all had the flights confirmed in the Qantas app and it said the credit was in our accounts. I never received any information to say I owed additional money, no emails, no calls and nothing in my online account or app.\nWe were able to check in to the airport using the app for our flight into Perth and had no issues.\nWhen I was in Perth, I attempted to check in for my return flight to which it said I was checked in but would have to collect a boarding pass from the service desk at the airport. I called to see if there were any issues. It was at this point while I was in another state that they proceeded to tell me that I had to pay another $309 to get home. I said that is not accurate but they refused to help so I went to the airport the following day to hopefully speak to someone in person. The lady at the desk called Elisabeth provided me with another terrible experience saying she could do nothing and I would have to call the reservations line again to sort it out. I said the flight leaves in an hour and it takes 40 minutes of being on hold before I can get through so she after making a big fuss called them herself. The whole time she mocked me and to who she was on the phone with directly in front of me. When I showed them the deal I booked and gave them the booking code that I had been provided they refused and said it wasn't valid. They said just because it said 'confirmed' in my app meant that I had a booking but I had to now pay for a ticket. I said if you listen to the recordings of the conversation you can hear them say they would honour the deal and it was all sorted, they then said no this will have been deleted now and the notes say something different. I said I had no additional funds to pay for a ticket to get home because their company told me the deal would be honoured. They refused and boarding was closing in 5 minutes so I was forced to borrow money from a family member to pay for the ticket. They said it wasn\u2019t their problem and it was up to me, even though they had let me fly into another state without telling me I still had money outstanding on my return flight. I asked for her full name which she refused and said to call her just 'Lizzy'. I asked for the name of the person on the phone and she said 'no I can't remember' even though she used it multiple times in the call and seemed to know them very well. I asked for her employee number and she refused. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she said no one could help me. My friends were able to check in normally the next day and returned home with no issues. They did not have to pay additional funds as I did.\nI tried to provide Qantas with feedback which I did twice and have not had a response in over two weeks. I have never had a more traumatic, draining or stressful experience with a company. Qantas could not have cared less about their customers experience and what they had to go through.","87":"This was the first leg of a flight to Hobart via Melbourne. We checked in as normal with a slighty tight connection but no indication of any delays. The lounge was average considering it was a business lounge. Some people offered icecreams and others (like us) ignored.\n\nThere was no gate shown on the board which started to make me nervous. Then it become clear that we could be late. The lounge staff were not helpful and just said oh well you have 20 minutes in Melbourne now, it will be fine.... Hmmmm sure!\n\nThe flight itself was fine and we got the good news from the purser that one of our pilots was operating the Hobart flight afterwards.\n\nThe meal was amazing - pumpkin crusted with dukka. Really good and friendly service.","88":"After an agreeable Auckland lounge experience we were very disappointed with the cramped business class seats, weak audio, limited range of Entertainment options, modest food & drink options. Staff were professional but overall experience was very underwhelming. It looked extremely uncomfortable in the 6 seats across economy class behind us. Would definitely try and avoid this aircraft and Qantas facilities in future.","89":"My seat 12F didn't recline, it was broken. Inflight entertainment did not work in my seat. Flight QF121 on May 14.\nThe food seemed to be made of plastic, poor quality.\nThe flight attendants were very kind, as they were aware of the poor service on board. Very sad to fly with Qantas.","90":"Uncomfortable seat, no leg space. I didn't have dinner, I didn't even have breakfast, the food seemed to be made of plastic, poor quality. The flight attendants were kind, as they were aware of the poor service on board. Qantas don't care about the passengers.","91":"Do not use! Hopeless they damaged my luggage. Changed my seat after I paid for a self allocated seat and put me up the back with screaming kids! Qantas are hopeless and your service or lack of has gone to mud So much turbulence and hopeless landing also","92":"Flew Christchurch\/Sydney\/Bangkok then Singapore\/Melbourne\/Christchurch. Aircraft fine, staff\/aircrew polite and helpful. But the food????? Very limited choice, chicken sandwich was well browned burger bun with light dressing and hint of chicken. And this is business class!!!! And this not a one off - flight from Singapore served up the same. Our inter connecting Qantas flight was delayed 12 hours, had to phone Qantas emergency number to reschedule, was told because a weekend call back Monday as staff away for the weekend!!!!! And this is emergency number. So Qantas, bad bad bad. Get your act together and dont leave other passengers stranded because it is a weekend. Would need to be desperate to fly Qantas again.","93":"I paid more than double the price of other carriers to fly with Qantas because I wanted a nice flight, and I wanted to support a 'nice' airline. In the past Qantas was generous, hospitable and thoughtful. But now they are totally short-term-profit-driven. I couldn't get a beer on a three-hour flight. I couldn't get a cup, or an ice cube for the one soft drink I was offered. I couldn't even get some tomato sauce for the one tiny pie I was given for lunch. The whole flight was just an succession of experiences of their cost-cutting. Qantas' upper-management are staunchly against their employee unions, their flight crews, and their employees in general. And now I can even see that they don't care about their customers, either. The whole thing just made me feel like a (small) number on their P&L statement. ...I'll never fly with these guys again. I'm going to support airlines that care about their people and airlines that give me 5c sauces and 1c ice cubes.","94":"Worst Australian company, treated us like cattle on the plane and the staff were rude delayed twice.","95":"We flew direct to Oz in Jan and didn\u2019t enjoy it. We have just flown back and had an excellent trip in a nearly new 787-9 Dreamliner with a great cabin crew.","96":"One hour late, back to the old standard ana the flight that was thirty minutes later after arrived in Sydney before us, Staff typical Qantas but the food--basic for business- a toasted cheese sandwich, Better than the Business Lounge which is revolting,. So sad. Cost control OK but customers pay the bill","97":"Can I give them MINUS 5 ***** ? Tried to buy wine using points & pay. System said it didn't work THREE TIMES. So I called and a supposed \"adviser\", Tom B, said they're just transitional & you won't be debited. I don't know whether he was LYING or just INCOMPETENT! The 3 debits went through to my account, as well as the 4th time with him when it was done with his supposed \"assistance\". Total debited = $1,460 instead of $365. Some days later QW refunded 2 of the 3 incorrect debits. Tom promised to get it fixed. Several days went by and no news = I cancelled the order. Tom sat on his fat behind and did nothing until told complaints will be coming. Finally got my 3rd debit back, but had to wait over a week for the refund of the actual buy. This meant it was after the Visa cycle closed so I have to fund their INCOMPETENCE for an extra month = UGGHH! Said I wanted compo for the 3 hours of my lost time their INCOMPETENCE had caused. Got Nada! So typical of a heavyweight using the old Chinese symbol of FU and crushing their customers. Guess we have fund the leprechaun's big salary & bonuses.","98":"Qantas service is just terrible these days. We used our points to fly business and we\u2019re really disappointed. Us passengers were just a nuisance to them and their chats. The service was appalling and offhand.\n\nThe flight left Apia late with no explanation or apology from pilots.\n\nAt least dinner was better than the breakfast on the outbound flight.\n\nThe best part is that we passengers don\u2019t get pillows and mattresses but the resting flight attendants lounging around in our business cabin do. Sums up Qantas and their approach to service. All senior staff who don\u2019t care.\n\nWe won\u2019t buy tickets in Qantas in future, and seriously rethinking who we earn points from. Time to move to velocity?\n\nLounge in Apia was small but at least they gave us service in there.","99":"Where to start? Toilets were STINKY. and not serviced with toilet paper and hand towel enough.\nMy TV was dirty with childrens handprints everywhere, the meal tray was also dirty. As the flight was not full I moved into the next seat only to find it the same.\nFor dinner I chose beef and vegetables, the vegs were cold and the meat barely warm, certainly not up to safe temperature.","100":"You have destroyed an Australian icon. Well done Joyce and team, you\u2019ve taken a great Australian product and destroyed it. Both my flights were delayed and not just for a few minutes, one was 1.3hrs and the other was 4hrs. The service was horrible and I\u2019m disgusted and the condition of the planes. You phone support is now embarrassing and it\u2019s no wonder why you need to keep reminding people not to be rude because you frustrate people so much.","101":"3pm departure scheduled. Now waiting till 8.45pm, maybe. They\u2019ve changed it 4 time. Hostess at counter was abrupt and dismissive. Food and amenities in the Business lounge average at best. At least the service staff are polite.\n\nFrustrating Australia does not have true competition in the air as their profit shows the contempt they show their customers. Shame to see a once great airline look and behave like a drug addled uncle.","102":"I had a return ticket from Melbourne to Madrid. I used the outbound flight but cancelled the return flight for which I said I was given flight credit. Regardless of how they under-calculated the flight credit, when I wanted to use my flight credit from Melbourne to Seoul, they said it is not possible as the credit should be used for the same route that I had cancelled the flight (Madrid to Melbourne)! I show them their own website information that says flight credit could be used in other routes, but they said it is not possible for me because I had used part of my flight (outbound) and only cancelled my return ticket! I feel cheated as such a condition is nonsense!","103":"What does the average traveller expect of an airline:\n# that safety standards are maintained.\n# the aircraft leaves and arrives on time.\n# the aircraft is clean.\n# aircrew are professional\n# luggage turns up when it should.\n\nI recently took two domestic flights with Qantas and on a number of the above points Qantas failed.\n\nBoth flights were late. Passengers were left scrambling to make connections and it was obvious that there was a failure to communicate. The planes were dirty. On my flight between Newcastle and Brisbane the section of seat behind the tray table was badly stained, on the flight between Brisbane and Bundaberg there were crumbs and rubbish from previous flights. The waiting area in the terminal in Brisbane was worn, dark and grubby.\n\nCabin crew were professional and efficient. They are not to blame. Qantas if you claim to be a full service airline- lift your game!","104":"Booked a Qantas holiday and needed to change the first leg if the flight from Melb to Syd to 1 hour later (from 12:00 noon to 1:00pm). Qantas charged me over $300 to change from one flight number to the next. Was disgusted after purchasing a Qantas holiday, my holiday insurance and car hire through them. Oh nit to mention that I am a club member. Customer service is dead. RIP...","105":"I recently travelled to the UK and three flights were required for the trip... the first leg was completed by Qantas on behalf of Emirates.\n\nBoarding was smooth with an on-time departure. Staff were engaging and friendly. Meals were very good on the flight. The only carry on I had was a small bag which meant I didn't have to vie for room in the overhead lockers that people manage to cram their essentials ( I swear for some of them it's a week or two worth of clothing).\n\nI did 6 flights to get to and from the UK in April and this was by far, the best of them.","106":"So, I booked a flight with Qantas to US from Singapore before COVID happened. Unfortunately, our flights got cancelled because of the pandemic and they gave us flight credits that expire in 2023.\n\nToday, I am trying to redeem the credits for the same flights from Singapore to the US but they don't allow it. They limit the destinations for the use of these flights credits to Australia or New Zealand, not places that I wanted to go or have ever wanted to go.\nI can't even transfer my credits to my friends who want to go to Australia.\nI have sent a number of emails to them and they do not reply. Their help desk is not helpful and hard to navigate.\nI am literally just watching my money go down the drain because of this greedy corporation.\nIf you are thinking of flying Qantas, I want you to know that they don't give a sh*t about you.","107":"Qantas managed to lose our luggage from an internal flight from Sydney to Brisbane a 1 hour journey!\nTheir customer service afterwards was terrible I spent 5 days on the phone trying to locate our luggage having to explain myself every time there is no customer service once you have travelled.\nWe had to go out and buy some basic clothes as we had nothing to wear( this was an holiday of a lifetime too) and 7 weeks later we still haven\u2019t received a penny.\nMy son found our luggage when he travelled to Brisbane to meet us they gave him it without any ID unbelievable!!\n\nNever travel with this airline","108":"I had booked to fly with Qantas on 4th October 2022 from Heathrow to Perth .As this was a 17 hour flight I was recommended to go by Premium Economy . After checking in , I was rung by Qantas , in the departure lounge to say I had been downgraded to Economy. Although they gave me some compensation at the time, they said I would need to apply for a refund of the difference in fares (\u00a3873) , via my travel agent , on my return home.\n\nThis was done on 4th November 2022. Six months later I am still waiting for that refund. I contacted Qantas customer care but they were no help at all.","109":"So disappointed with the standards of Qantas. We were served lunch, which was 2 small sausages, lots of mash potato & pees. Sorry to say but it was very much the standard of some nursing home food! The flight was 50 mins late departing, no issues with the weather conditions. Qantas co-share with Emirates so our return trip from Christchurch was an Emirates flight and wow the food was just amazing and 1st class standard for Economy class. It was a dinner flight on the return, but the overall experience was one that we would definitely book Emirates next time!","110":"I flew back from Honolulu to Sydney last week in Business Class on QF104. The Qantas A330 is an excellent international aircraft with plenty of space and a lie-flat bed. As is usually the case, the flight attendants were great, couldn't do enough for us and were professional and very friendly. The food was great, except that they didn't have any of my lunch choice left, and the champagne plus other drinks were free flowing. The only issue with this flight was that it was late in boarding, they told us due to the cleaning crew still being on the plane at that time, which resulted in both boarding as well as take-off and landing all being about an hour late.","111":"Ground staff very rude & unhelpful. Need their help for some information, they replied that they don't know. They severely tarnished Qantas reputation.","112":"We flew on the new A330 route to Samoa and were in business class using our frequent flyer points. The seat was good and so was the entertainment but the rest was poor\u2026\n\nSenior cabin crew who had a half empty cabin but could not be bothered to give service, resting flight attendants sitting in business seats playing on phones while my polite request for a tea was ignored etc\u2026. My tray table was filthy too.\n\nThe catering was very average and they don\u2019t even load pillows and blankets. The excuse was COVID but what the? I flew to London on Qantas in 2021 and got a pillow and a blanket\u2026.\n\nBaggage at other end was slow and not delivered in priority order.\n\nI would have been really annoyed if I had paid cash for this.","113":"Never use this airline! They lost our luggage for 5 days on our major holiday their customer service was horrendous we spent hours every day trying to call them to locate our luggage. You have to explain yourselves every time which is so frustrating.\nSince we have been home we have been waiting 6 weeks for our money back for emergency clothing we get told every time another two weeks to wait because they have too many claimed, this tells you something about the airline","114":"Had the good fortune of flying to the Gold Coast for a winter break with Qantas on a credit trip not taken last year. The process was so easy and the airline actually felt as if they wanted to help me in any way possible... making suggestions and recommendations about travel. Everything was organised without fuss. The trip was excellent and service staff great!","115":"Qantas remains the worse airline I\u2019ve ever come across in my experience on the 24 Feb 2023 from Singapore to London. They have no competent personnel to address complaints regarding issues of; no online checkin, arrogant pilot and flight crew, lying ground crew, late take off and arrival, late retrieval of luggage. Their CEO Alan Joyce and Customers Director Markus Svensson are no better and invisible to the complaints when I copied them in. They should fold the business for good in my opinion when their customer reviews are generally so bad, ranging from 1.5-3.5 out of 5. It\u2019s a pity the score starts from 1, or else I would have given them a zero.","116":"This was a reward booking on the all economy 717 plane. We got the exit row which was good for extra legroom. The service was pleasant enough with wine offered for free but the catering is terrible. I hate the runny salsa and chips pack. They give it out so often. Over it! No streaming of entertainment on the flight. On arrival no priority given to priority tagged bags\u2026 we get there about 20 minutes late.","117":"Domestically they still cancel flights left right and center - you just cannot rely on them - Its the lies that gets to me - the reasons range from air traffic to technical to staff shortage to the dog ate my homework, IF you need to to busines or have connecting flights, avoid them at all costs . What a disgarce to Australia . My last trip, both depart and return flights cancelled. Got a 15$ meal voucher though.. oooooo - these peopek are serious ...","118":"Great airline, one of the best, staff in all areas are always so helpful and friendly where some airline staff can be a bit stuffy the Qantas team just get on with the job. The check in was super fast and efficient, boarding time was quick and the flight was on time and hassle free. Nothing to not like about Qantas, shame they don't do internal UK flights as they knock the socks off the majority of airlines that cover internal routes.","119":"I was doing 3 connecting flights from Wellington to Philadelphia. The first flight, from 4 am to 6:45 am we sat in the waiting area. We were supposed to board at 5:10 am. This 1:35 delay made me miss my next flight, so the rescheduled me to another flight. No biggie. But they then wouldn't give me my replacement boarding pass because it was 55 minutes from take off time. (1 hour necessary for weighing the plane(?)) so they had to rebook me again- with now a 6 hour layover in Sydney. The whole rebooking process took over an hour, and when I asked why my initial flight was delayed the way it was, the flight attendant said it was an issue with the bakery.\nThey gave us a F*king cookie. Its a 3 hour flight. Just say \u2018sorry, no food this flight so as to not delay 50 people with connections.\u2019 It was a 28 hour travel day, that a qantas cookie turned into a 34 hour travel day. Needless to say, i will be looking to avoid qantas in the future. Reading their other reviews, this seems to be a common occurrence. To be fair, their staff was patient, for the most part. That was appreciated.","120":"Flown this route several times and EVERY single time, delays by Qantas meant having to buy a new connecting flight within SA due to not being able to make the original booking. Hate this airline!! Thank you for nothing Qantas!!!!","121":"A word of warning, be very, very careful amending a booking online. Qantas's systems are flaky at best. We ended up with a paid seat transaction for 2 people that only went through partially. Apparently someone had grabbed the other seat while we were completing the transaction. We lost our previous seats. Trying to get a refund is like trying to get blood from a stone.","122":"Horrible policies, horrible customer service. I would say there is NO service. Qantas simply don't respond to emails and when they do, they are so not helpful. 1. At Qantas they don't take responsibility for your checked in luggage or for any missing parts of it that have been damaged during the flight (I flew with many other companies in EU such as Lufthansa where it's an opposite example). 2. Qantas cancel flights in the last minute which where paid a top price - absolutely unacceptable when the airline is not a cheap charter company. 3. Qantas treat people if they are a forgotten luggage. I will personally avoid at all costs flying Qantas. Absolutely no value provided for the prices they demand.","123":"It was unexpected for me to find out that the airline declined to offer any support for replacing or fixing my damaged baggage, despite me reporting the damage. They deemed the damage as typical wear and tear","124":"Baggage was delayed on arrival at Queenstown. Completed all formalities and was advised that we could buy up to A$200 each for necessities. We duly did and total for both of us under NZ$200. Submitted the claim for the refund. That\u2019s when the fun began. Claim was submitted on 1 Jan 2023. To date and many emails and phone calls still no refund and no correspondence from Qantas. Now it\u2019s not about the money it\u2019s now about the principle. Worst customer service from an airline I have ever received. I am fairly well travelled and have flown on quite a few airlines, both National carriers and budget, never received such bad service. If you want a tip, never fly Qantas even if the flight is free.","125":"After spending a lovely 5 day holiday in Surfers Paradise with my family (2 adults and 2 children), we used public transport to get to Brisbane airport, this was easy to do and cheap (took about 2 and 1\/2 hours).\n\nWe arrived at the Qantas check-in and we couldn't check-in our bags. Yes we were super early (~6 hours before our flight). But with no one at the check-in we had no idea when we could. My partner tried ringing Qantas but got no response. There was little to no communication from them apart from when my partner had checked us in the previous day, and this was to say that due to flooding the check-in was via the kiosks. (Seemed plausible until we arrived - kiosks were on the 4th floor).\n\nPlane was late leaving in the end, meant to leave at 6.40pm, didn't depart until close to 8pm, again not communicated this. Just kept saying that boarding was soon.\n\nAfter sitting down in the seats we realized we had made a bad decision, seats super narrow, no leg room and the belt was only just long enough. Are only short and skinny people allowed to fly, since I felt very uncomfortable during the next 4 hours of the flight.\n\nThe meal was pretty good, that's about the only positive on this flight.\n\nThe headset had a bad wire connection, the touch screen was very slow to operate, could hardly hear the communication from captain although this could be due to the very noisy plane.\n\nTo sum up our experience, we had expected more from the Australians national carrier, but nope it's just a glorified Jetstar. We will now and forever use AirNZ, since all the problems we had with Qantas was not an issue with AirNZ. Cost between these two flights weren't alot and we didn't want to fly Jetstar for all the reasons we experienced on Qantas. How wrong were we.","126":"We visited from America and flew Qantas for the first time. I liked the free onboard Viasat Wi-Fi that worked throughout the flight. I also liked the free tablets to see movies. I liked the announced request to respect others. Improvements: Use the monitors to inform pax. 1 Please tell pax how you will board them. First come first served? By row from the back of the plane? By zone? All good options but tell us what will happen! 2 Put info on monitors. Do not just communicate by speaking Australian English because some people do not speak English in an international airport! If you put info on the monitor, then people who are not fluent can read the text or use a translation app. 3 If you only give information by speaking, it discriminates against deaf people.","127":"Flight from Sydney to London had a delay of just under 12 hours in Singapore, should have been a 2 hour stop over. Nowhere to stay\/sleep or eat during that time. We lost one full day of our 4 day stay in London as a result. We should have arrived in London just after 6am. We arrived just before 5pm. The flight crew from Sydney to Singapire were great, very attentive and appeared happy to be dealing with us. Our son received a children's play pack. The second crew from Singapore to London treated us like we were a major inconvenience to them. Asking them for a drink after 5 hours of no service was met with a grunt, an eye roll and a very curt response of \"fine\". One can of drink was given to my husband when we both asked for one, no glass provided. The response to the initial request made me too hesitant to ask where the second can was. The entire second leg of the flight was a horrible experience. We were kept waiting g for 15 minutes at the departure for a first class passenger who couldn't be bothered to arrive on time. In a A380, 90% of the paying customers are in economy but 99% of all attention is on the 3 people in first class. This has been a long awaited holiday - my first in 30 years and I am so disappointed that I chose Qantas. Won't make that mistake again.","128":"An hour late in taking off due to technical issues (hear it a lot on Qantas flights). Physical size of aircraft and toilet amenities totally inadequate for number of passengers on a flight in excess of four hours eg Melbourne to Perth. We calculated 2 wc cubicles for approximately 160 people plus flight crew. Front end wc not permitted for economy class passengers as communicated by head stewardess. Too bad if you needed to use urgently!!\nFood served in soggy cardboard boxes. Unbelievable! Spirit of Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa don't think so. PS flight attendants do the best they can under the circumstances and are always pleasant.","129":"Stranded in Singapore airport for over 6 hours, we were given $20 vouchers each and most of the shops within the airport didn't take them. So we had to use our own money again, we had to rebook another coach for an additional \u00a388 we had to rearrange taxis and pay more.\n\nIt was detrimental on our health. It took us nearly a week to adjust back again and obviously those 6 hours didn't help. It was poor communication on the delay. We had nowhere to stay but in plastic chairs for 12 hours. There were bodied sleeping on the floor, steps behind\/beside us.\n\nI've flown with so many other airlines and they have been so considerate in delays. However THIS company you couldn't get blood out of a stone.\n\nSo here is the kicker...\nQantas offered us GBP53.92 (AUD100) between the two of us. It's absolutely pathetic a big company like this offering so petty amounts. This didn't even cover our two drinks. So if you get delayed don't expect the world because you will get fisted.\n\nAVOID flying with this company.\nI will never fly with this company again after spending over \u00a34,000 on flights.","130":"This was my first-time flying on Qantas from Christchurch, New Zealand to Seattle, USA with stopovers at Sydney and Los Angeles. I have pledged to myself that it is my very LAST TIME EVER to fly on Qantas. Their customer service is nothing but disappointing and callous. They never admit to making mistakes and never own up to responsibilities. NEVER fly on Qantas ever again.\n\nMy connecting flight from Los Angeles to Seattle via Alaska Airlines (codeshare partner) was never booked and confirmed despite their email confirmation sent to me when I paid for the entire itinerary. It was one hell of nightmare for the two of us getting stuck at LAX when Alaska Airlines had no tickets for us to board the connecting flight. We were unable to board and ended up getting stuck at LAX for 12 long hours to finally catch the next available flights after exhaustive work done by the passengers (me and my wife). Qantas failed to pass our ticketing information to Alaska Airlines the entire time since tickets were purchased and paid for a month before the departure date. Despite Qantas email confirmation explicitly confirming the Alaska connecting flight, it was false and incorrect. Alaska has its own unique booking system requiring totally different booking record numbers from Qantas booking record numbers. Yet Qantas failed to convert to Alaska unique system the entire time. When I reported the horrific experience to Qantas post-flight, they had no sympathy, no admission to error, and obviously no desire to own up to their mistake. I submitted all evidence to Qantas which only went to a black hole.\n\nI was so wrong that Qantas was a reputable airline carrier. So wrong about this! I will NEVER fly on Qantas. Negative reviews written by other users about Qantas are valid and worth noting. For your own sake, stay away from Qantas.","131":"Very poor service at Learmonth Airport today 25\/04\/23. The flight to Perth QF1603 left with a delay of over 1 hour which caused people to miss their connecting flight to Sydney. When boarding the plane at Learmonth airport, Qantas staff did not have a scanning machine for the boarding passes. Instead the name of each passenger had to be crossed off a list. Then the count didn\u2019t match up and people had to wait for another count to be done. It was very poor. People had to wait 7.5 hours in Perth for the next flight to Sydney which was the Red Eye. Very disappointing.","132":"Business seat was not reclining and I was offered a 100% refund by ground staff if I chose to travel. I was assured that customer service would follow through. The 15 hour journey was uncomfortable even though I had paid an arm and leg for it. After multiple email exchanges spanning 9 days I was offered a AUD 500 voucher for a flight originating from Australia and told that ticket would not be refunded. This was the absolute worst way to end a holiday.","133":"Three hour delay, bumped to crappy seat near window which agrivates my back injury, same old crappy biscuits.\n\nJust gets worse every time I travel with them\nStaff great, food and flight delays poor.\n\nI booked my flight so I would not have three trip home due to peak hour. Why bother when you cannot rely on bookings.","134":"Worst airline ever- never ever use them as a carrier. They cancelled our connecting flight and rebooked it the following day. We were stuck in Sydney for the night and Qantas was unwilling to help us. Lucky our connecting flight was with Emirates and they helped us with the process of getting out of the airport and finding us someone from Qantas which was next to impossible. I was talking to Qantas the entire time on the phone and they were so unwilling to help and even blaming us for booking the flight on the wrong day which was not true, they then said Emirates had concealed our ticket and Qantas could not update us as they did not have my email- which is also untrue as our flights had all been booked online and you can not do that with out providing an email- she later said she had sent the new details to my email which she magically managed to do without us even providing the email address that she did not have. Lucky the manager at the counter was far more reasonable and helped us find out what has happened and yes it was Qantas!! They had been unbooking and rebooking our flights on their own accord to get a cheaper deal through Emirates\u2026 and had done it multiple times and then rebooked on the flowing day. The counter manager was able to get us a room for the night and a taxi back and forward- unfortunately by this time we had already been sitting the at airport trying to get everything sorted for HOURS! We had a about 3 hours at the hotel and then had to be back to continue on our journey. It was the dishonesty and the blame game that made this 1000 times worse. Will never fly with Qantas again!!","135":"Just wanted to say a huge 5\/5 star review to the guy on the desk in Melbourne who\u2019s name I didn\u2019t catch, but who was extremely helpful and was excellent in helping us change our flight after some misinformation in Sydney. He was a young chap with a moustache and glasses. Really couldn\u2019t be more grateful for his help. The in flight support was also great. Will definitely be travelling with you again.","136":"My son travelled from Bangalore to Sydney in a direct flight of around 11.5 hours. The experience was pathetic. First of all the flight was delayed for an hour. And secondly he was never offered food on the flight. A kid travelling alone and not even offered food for straight 12.5 hours is nothing but hopeless service.We are never opting to travel again in Qantas.","137":"The plane to Bali was much smaller than in the past and the seats were very uncomfortable. The food was inedible, and I usually enjoy airline food. However, the staff were as wonderful as ever and we did depart and arrive at the scheduled times. A lot of us went to Bali at the same time and those that flew Jetstar had a horrible experience. Their flight turned around after two hours, due to mechanical problems and it took them several days to finally get another flight. One friend who was booked with Jetstar couldn't wait and finally re-booked with Qantas to ensure that they actually got to their destination.","138":"Late again, this time by one hour thereby impacting our schedule and follow on activities. QANTAS truly is a poorly run airline and they should be ashamed of their performance. The airline was dated with no entertainment system and cleanliness was poor. Food on this occasion was satisfactory.","139":"You would think that a one-hour 15 minute flight between two capital cities would be a routine task for the largest Australian owned airline; think again as the airline was late again and it appeared that airline staff shared little care or empathy. To cap it off the aircraft was filthy with food scraps on our seat and floor.","140":"As usual, 3 hours delay for an hour flight, no one says anything, then inside the plane for 2 hours before the take off, disgusting company, disgusting staff","141":"Sat right next to the toilet, literally in my row, so you could smell, hear and feel the unpleasantries next door. What\u2019s more the plane ran out of fuel and then instead of taking 17 hours to get home it took 29!","142":"Check in staff for Qantas were rude, refused to check me in until they opened the flight and told me to come back. When I did check in, no priority ticket was placed on my luggage so delays on arrival waiting for the bags.\n\nThe Qantas international lounge in Brisbane airport was woeful, crowded, loud and the most uncomfortable seats I have ever encountered. Food was ordinary.\nPhone recharging was hit and miss as half don't work.\n\nFlight crew were excellent in business class. Friendly and engaging.\nFlatbed seats, still confining, hard and uncomfortable. Definitely needs a revamp.","143":"After having a joint family celebration in Sydney, we all returned to Melbourne on flight QF477 and it couldn\u2019t have been more enjoyable.\n\nThe staff doted on my Grandson and he loved it! Mentioning to them that this is only his second flight - the first being in a Dash 8. They broke us up by saying - Don\u2019t Mention the \u2018D\u2019 Word!!\n\nI have to add the A330\u2019s comfort in Business Class was an added bonus.","144":"My Qantas flight was one of the best I had. I got upgraded to business after putting in a request before the flight. The miracle of an upgrade made the long 13 and a half hour flight a lot less painful. The crew weee wonderful with even getting me my dinner hot and fast as I was tired from the day before. I quickly went to sleep in the padded massage like flat business class seats which were a wonderful upgrade from the previous in 2020 and before. Once I woke up I headed to the wonderful spacious business and first onboard lounge which had plenty of fruit and snacks and a place to sit and relax in a luxurious living room style area. When I went back to my seat to have breakfast the crew was very quick to greet me and say good morning and bring me some juice of my choice before my breakfast came. My breakfast was very enjoyable and delicious.\n\nI rare my experience as one to remember and I will definitely fly Qantas again and would 1000% recommend this wonderful accommodating airline to many who would like to fly and travel the world.","145":"As regular travellers to Perth for many years to visit family, usually with Qatar who are excellent, we thought we'd try the non stop Qantas flight in premium economy at \u00a32500 each, to avoid any possible COVID stops. Travelling in December 2022 returning January 23.\n\nWe booked exactly 11 months early through dial a flight (Tara) who were excellent, and booked our seats, one of the pairs. About 3 months later I went on to manage my booking to find our seats were not booked as we would have to wait to book them the day before flying. Spoke to dial a flight who were as bemused as we were but suggested we pay the balance early to see if that worked, it did not! I was on the manage my booking every day for 3 months before a pair of seats were available outbound and 6 weeks later I managed to get return seats. All the time their website was saying book your flights then book your seats! Oh no you can't! I am still waiting a reply to my complaint from Qantas Customer Service that I sent in June 2022.\n\nAt Heathrow we checked in and got through security etc. to find that our flight had no take off time. After a while it said we were delayed 10 hours and we all trouped off to the Qantas desk to be told a pilot was either ill or out of hours. We received a \u00a35 voucher each as compensation. We booked into a lounge for \u00a372 only to soon find the screen said we were to go to gate for boarding. We eventually took off about 5 hours late. Flight not too bad and plane ok, premium seats are wider and a little extra legroom but entertainment very poor and food not very good. Staff were very good but this is a very long time to be sat on a plane. I thought I'd got bedsores on my bottom after 12 hours.\n\nOn the return flight they had moved us from a pair to the 3 seats in the middle. They didn't bother telling us so we only found out on the plane! Staff said our seats had problems with the entertainment system (it probably bored itself to death!). A lady then sits in our original seats, tries both and watched the screen in both until she put her feet up and slept. Staff chose to ignore my complaints. My lamb shank was not bad on the flight but the rest of the meal wasn't great agan. Breakfast was all but inedibl and the calzone snack was like eating a brick. The plane again was ok generally but when the best thing on the entertainment is a repeat of the Repair Shop, no sport very few games, lots of Hitchcock films...17 hours becomes a very long time.\n\nAfter we got back we received a survey from Qantas which I filled in appropriately finishing by saying ' if this is qantas' flagship service then Qantas management should hang their heads in shame!' not that they'll ever read it.\n\nYou can get better service and value for money from most major airlines and a couple of hours at Singapore or Doha can be very pleasant and lets you stretch your legs. Qantas do not deserve our support, awful customer service from a major airline.","146":"My first trip to Australia and Qantas made it a nightmare. I understand that there might be delays due to maintainance and other things but atleast the airlines should take responsibility and compensate the customers. Because of the delay with Qantas arriving at Sydney airport( 1 hr 30 min delay), I couldn\u2019t catch my domestic flight to Brisbane and Qantas showed no sympathy nor compensated us. There service manager at the domestic terminal showed no respect whatsoever and shewed us away from the counter. Won\u2019t travel with Qantas again. In addition, I had a pregnant wife and 5 year old wee one who wasn\u2019t overly happy with the whole experience.\n\nPNR: LMGF5N","147":"Whatever you do, do not EVER fly with Qantas. They lost my bag on the other side of the world and then let it sit in the airport for days (known by me due to an AirTag) but they did not even confirm my bag had arrived in the country, they didn\u2019t check it in online, they didn\u2019t tell me anything on the phone and told me I had to wait to be contacted. I couldn\u2019t contact the airport staff and left endless voicemails. My bag was due to be delivered to me the next day and three days later I had moved accommodation so it would never have been delivered as I had no way of changing the delivery address or contacting them. I went back to the airport at my own cost after having to buy more emergency supplies (given I was only due to be without it for a day) and it took 3 hours for them to give me my bag which was literally on the other side of a wall on a trolley. There were no staff at the airport or desks open. A manager treated me appallingly after begrudgingly coming down to see me (I was in tears with stress and frustration at this point). Eventually a lady walked past by chance and after around 45 minutes to an hour bought out my bag which had not even been put through customs.\n\nI am now five months into a complaint following and when they finally realised they were to blame, not another airline - two they have tried to blame on multiple occasions (including one that I didn\u2019t even fly with), I\u2019ve received the same template email for the third time. It took them over two months to respond to one email and I am now looking to take legal action.\n\nMy second experience was an internal flight within Australia which was significantly delayed and we were not kept up to date and the compensation was 15 AUD to spend on a smoothie in the airport.\n\nI will never use them again and would not recommend Qantas to anyone. This debacle ruined the first part of my trip and has caused me no end of stress since.","148":"I had made a booking to fly to South Africa from Auckland. I had multiple tabs open because I was trying to find the best flight and mistakenly booked the wrong dates 10 minutes after the booking was made I had called and asked to change dates to which the lady informs me is going to be an extra $2000 difference and then advised me that it would be best to take a refund. After confirming that the refund would only take a week to process I agreed. It's been 15 days, and I called back only to be told if it hasn't been processed in a week then it'll take up to 4 weeks. I mean if I had known that earlier I could've changed dates to find a more suitable time to fly back out where the difference wasn't so expensive. The guy helping me on the phone was literally a robot who just repeated the same thing over and over again and after me saying if I had know it would take 4 weeks I could have changed dates decided to go silent and then proceed to tell me the same thing again. Just based off this experience alone I'd never recommend flying with them, I'd rather fork out the bit extra and fly with Emirates like I usually do.","149":"1st leg delayed by 45 minutes meaning missing connection flight. Considering 1st flight in the morning, clear skies no excuses. 5 hours of my holiday spent sitting in an airport. Staff provided no accountability, just passed onto Fiji Airways who were great.\n\nSurprise surprise the return flight was also delayed.\n\nLoyal customer saying goodbye","150":"Booked early to choose seats and paid extra to upgrade to exit row for additional legroom. Confirmed by QANTAS with receipt for additional charges. Booking ref 5O8ZX9 .. just in case anyone at QANTAS reads this and follow up.\n\n24 Hour check in found seats had been changed to regular seats at back of plane. No explanation or apology or offer to refund additional costs !\n\nTERRIBLE call centre experience when we tried to sort this out:\n1. JOY - advised flight went DIRECT Sydney to London with no stops so we cannot have been issued 2 seat numbers (flight actually goes via Singapore with brief transit stop & plane change). Hung up when we explained there is a stop ....\n2. RAVEN - took all details then hung up .......\n3. NOX - initially offered to add note to booking to \"try\" to have this fixed at airport when we drop bags. Advised call centre staff cannot access seating details and recommended we take receipts, proof of payment for upgrades and have it sorted at airport.","151":"We had a flight from our home regional airport (which was cancelled the night before) and then got bumped from the Brisbane-Sydney Business Class leg (once again the night before flying) and could only offer us an earlier flight when we wouldn\u2019t have even been in Brisbane! We eventually got it sorted and flew Economy!\n\nOn the way back (Sydney-Brisbane) they ran out of food on Business Class and could only offer us a toasted cheese sandwich! Should have flown Economy!\n\nPi\u00e8ce de resistance \u2013 they lost our luggage - only one bag arrived and not the other which were checked in at the same time. The bag eventually showed up at 10pm that night but they were unable to deliver it to the Airport hotel we were staying at.\n\nA real shame that Qantas has dropped the bundle!","152":"I had 2 flights for this trip, first, a 17 hour flight from London to Perth, second, a 5 hour flight from Perth to Brisbane. My first flight was on time leaving, early landing in Perth, it was a very smooth flight with little turbulence and they brought round food and drinks quite a lot keeping passengers happy and full. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful and the inflight entertainment was good. My second flight was slightly delayed but this wasn't an issue for me as it landed on schedule, there was no personal inflight entertainment but I didn't expect there to be as it was a shirt haul domestic flight and they put a film on the main screen and gave out headphones to those that wanted to watch it. Again, it was a nice smooth flight without much turbulence. The only reason I have put 4 instead of 5 is because towards the end of the first flight I got told that I couldn't use my inflatable travel pillow which I had been using all flight without anyone saying anything and when I said okay can I just ask why the response I got was that it was policy. I didn't mind deflating it but I was curious to know why as all other airlines allow them and they are sold in airports and I got the impression the cabin crew didn't know why either. All in all a very positive experience and I would recommend, just this one thing that stopped me giving a 5 star review.","153":"Paid extra for Qantas flight for comfort and entertainment ( hoping to have a screen for my todler). No screens, no extra service and uncomfortable seats. I understand that not all planes are new and beautiful but unhappy with the extra cost in comparison.","154":"I travelled on a domestic flight which was only 1.5hrs flight time and arrived at 9am. They managed to send my baggage to an incorrect destination which was also a short haul domestic flight. They promptly found my bag and then put it on another flight that same day in the afternoon but that flight was cancelled. There were two more flights that departed after the cancelled flight and instead of putting my baggage on either of those flights it remained in Brisbane overnight. The next flight was then late morning the next day so I didn\u2019t have my baggage for over 24hrs. In my baggage I had an esky bag with food and ice brick with perishable items which by the next day had to be thrown out.","155":"How silly is this airline?? I bought two tickets in one transaction, and they took payment twice, once for each passenger which then triggers two separate international transaction fees by the bank. I called them and asked about it, and they said it's the bank's fault. I questioned why even though it is one transaction, one bill, one flight, and one total amount, they chose to charge individually per passenger? And they had no answer, it's just something that they do. So what if I were to fly all 5 of my family members, they would charge 5 times separately per passenger, and it would then trigger 5 separate international transaction fees?!","156":"Our 20th wedding anniversary has just been ruined by Qantas. 10.30am flight to Thailand cancelled at 10pm the night before Good Friday. Next flight is over 8 hours later and requires we overnight in Singapore.\nI have a disability so trying to find a suitable hotel at such short notice during school holidays is a nightmare. We\u2019ve lost a night of prepaid accomodation in Thailand, paid for dog boarding for a night not now required. That aside, plans for our vow renewal ceremony are now in tatters as we effectively lose 2 days of our break.\nCall centre staff were rude and no help. Qantas compensation for all this upheaval is $200.\n\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c","157":"Qantas changed my flight time so I miss a connection in Dallas. No assistance was offered apart from telling me to return to the booking agent who want to charg\u00e9 $60 to reissue a connecting flight ticket. Qantas would not concede it was their fault and after paying over $300o I then needed to pay extra to the ticketing agency .\nAn absolute disgrace","158":"They had a plane issue since Monday and waiting til Thursday to take it out of action..Received a text advising flight delay only received once at airport. Delayed 8 hours and then waiting til nearly boarding to advise us plane is being replaced from New Zealand but not til 6pm. Lack of communication from Qantas. AND they think a voucher for food will make up for 12 hour delay. Never flying Qantas again.","159":"this was a better flight as the plane is more roomy and younger than the going ob=ver to perth.\nCrew were very friendly\nFood was tasty and again in a cardboard box with cardboard utensils Again the one chocolate was served an 1 hour before landing .","160":"this was a flight that was good but felt like an older plane. My video pad was slightly hanging in the spot .\nThe food was tasty but served in a cardboard box with cardboard utensils with a chocolate lindt served about 1 hour before landing Yes one chocolate. The crew were very friendly","161":"Qantas where do i start, we decided to treat ourselves as we were flying to Perth for our sons wedding Booked premium econemy direct flight from Heatrow but it took weeks of daily phone calls to get them to take payment. Just before boarding we were told inflight entertainment system to our seats was not working and there were no alternative seats. Only thing they offered us was $100 wine voucher each but we had to be frequent flyer members , so we joined.For some reason Qantas has the wrong phone number on my husbands account so we cannot sign into it to claim the wine voucher which now has run out, by the way my husband uses my number. We have not resolved this as we are still waiting for a proper responce from Qantas. The flight home, the entertainment was working, the unit where screen comes up was broken but had black tape on it as a fix, my screen was filthy with stuff on it that you ( if you wanted) could scratch off. I had the scramled egg and bacon breakfast which can only be descrbed as sloppy mush even the bacon. I certainly did not expect this in premium econemy. Expected better help to resolve issues, still waiting for Qantas responce","162":"After 4 calls and multiple email my ticket i have not received a confirmation of flight yet. The ticket is(apparently) sitting in the queue?!?\n\nEverytime i call they say it will be ticketed in 24 hours, and nothing happen.\n\nThey took the payment right away.\n\nThis is just the last of the incident i had with this company.\n\nCalling the call center takes often several hours and if you manage to take the line there's not much these people can do.\n\nI will never again use their service Qantas\/Jetstar and would encourage anyone not to give their money to these people.","163":"Couldn't find the business class lounge at Delhi International Airport even though we asked at other lounges ( Air India, Emirates). Eventually someone told us it was in an Irish pub ! In disbelief we located the pub and indeed this was where we were meant to be. The pub offered free meals - burgers and chips being the main item. I ordered a soup but that never arrived. There was no wine at the bar, just liquor and beer. The music was loud and overpowering, competing with two tv screens. We thought at least we would only be there an hour. However a Qantas official told us before we left that the flight had been delayed 30 minutes. Unable to put up with the pub a minute longer we left to go to the departure gate, where we were told the half hour delay was now one hour. Soon after the delay turned into 2 hours, then 3. Most people left the departure lounge to get some food ( It was now 1030pm). Ok, planes get delayed for one reason or other, but we were never told the reason why. Why cannot Qantas negotiate with another airline to let business travellers into a proper lounge ! By the way, our business class seat Sydney to Kolkata took us to Hyderabad, thereafter we were put in an economy seat for 3 hours on Indigo Air economy seat to get to Kolkata. So much for paying business class prices !","164":"Sometimes you have a nice flight and sometimes just the opposite. On my flight from Auckland back to Melbourne, I had the misfortune of sitting next to a person who has taken 25% of my seat. I wonder if the airline couldn't organize this a little better when checking in. Being overweight isn't a bad thing, but simply taking a piece of space away from a passenger who isn't the thinnest either can't be right. So, Qantas, think about it. And while you're already thinking, you should take a look at this breakfast. Would Qantas executives like that too? Inedible for me. There was a time, many, many years ago, when you looked forward to eating on an airplane.","165":"First time flying with Quantas and must say I had no issues. check-in was fine, flight was on time, good quality food served and lovely cabin staff.","166":"Looking to minimise wasted time checking in at Melbourne Airport, we checked in on line.\nOn arrival to travel, we found there was no queue for persons who had already checked in on line . So, no option but to join a 45 minute queue comprising all types of passengers (other than business or platinum ticket holders) checking in\nWhat a contrast to the practice of other more progressive, customer focused airlines at Melbourne who have designated on-line check-in queues.","167":"Self-service machine useless.. When you arrive you get told to go on the machines, only to get all the way to the end and it states you need staff assistance.. clearly why no one else was on the machines when we arrived. Severely short staffed. Lined up and moved THREE times to three seperate queues! Thank god we arrived three hours before check in. After that experience, we will never fly with Qantas again.","168":"We used QANTAS for a number of domestic flights during a recent visit to Australia from the United Kingdom. It started off being only two flights, from Sydney to Wagga Wagga on 10 February, and from Canberra to Darwin on 12 February. However, around 8 weeks prior to our departure, the non-stop flight from Canberra to Darwin was changed to an indirect flight from Canberra to Melbourne, with a very tight connection in Melbourne for the flight to Darwin. The flights were QF1529 (6.35pm departure, and 7.45pm arrival), with connection to QF838 (8.25pm departure, and 11.15pm arrival). Our departure from Canberra was late, and with a very long walk at Melbourne Airport to reach the gate for the connection to Darwin, time was tight and the flight had almost finished boarding when we reached the boarding gate. Thankfully we were able to board, and baggage was loaded and arrived safely in Darwin.\n\nThere\u2019s a couple of things worth noting:\n1. At no point on any of our check-ins and boardings with QANTAS were we asked to show any form of identity. This is standard practice in many parts of the world, and certainly in the UK (where I live) and wider Europe.\n2. There was free wifi on the flight to Darwin; it worked reasonably well.\n3. There was no charging points at the seat on the Boeing 737 aircraft.\n4. All passengers were served a hot meal; the cottage pie I was served was quite tasty; it was a pleasant surprise. We had expected to pay for food and beverages on this flight of nearly 4 hours.\n5. The flight was fairly full, and overhead bin space was at a premium; no checks at the boarding area appeared to be made to monitor the size and volume of hand luggage passengers are carrying.\n\nThere\u2019s choices for domestic travel in Australia. We initially choose QANTAS because of the convenience of the flight from Canberra to Darwin. We did not fly QANTAS for our flight from Darwin to Brisbane. We always monitor the options and choose the best option for us, as we hold no allegiance to QANTAS.","169":"Booked the flight 12months in advance,paid top dollar, was unable to check in online system was down.Tried for 14 hrs before giving up. Checked in at counter and was\nallocated the last seats in the plane [backs against the wall]The seating was so tight the drop down table sat on my chest [and i'm not a big guy] The whole journey I rubbed shoulders and legs with the person alongside. The meal served was like Dog Vomit,They called it Ravioli. Qantas WAS my preferred airline but no more.","170":"Having last flown with Qantas in 2007 we have avoided them since then as they were terrible then but as their new fares in Business Class were actually better in most cases than the opposition we decided to take the punt.\nIn all our previous 7 trips to the USA we have flown Air NZ business class or Virgin Business Class when they used to fly to the states.\nIt all started poorly for Qantas when our 10.30pm flight was delayed. We ended up leaving Brisbane after 1.30am.\nHaving paid a huge premium for our fares we expected that as Business Class travellers we would get what Qantas advertise and that is priority boarding. No such luck\u2026.\nEvery passenger was shunted thru like cattle and business class passengers were put into the queue with economy and waited inline. So much for priority\u2026\nOnce on board and in my cubicle I was in no mood to eat anything so asked the flight attendant to please make up my bed.\nWent to the men\u2019s and when I came back the bed wasn\u2019t made but the FA told me I needed to complete the bed service myself. Seriously is this what Qantas call business class?\nWhen we last flew Air NZ this service was carried out with a smile: was prompt and the bed itself was much more comfortable and larger than that provided by Qantas.\nWith our return flight imminent I can only hope that Qantas will finally take heed of the poor reviews and get their act together.\nAt this point they can only aspire to provide the same level of service that Air NZ do and having waited 16 years to fly with them after our return flight it is unlikely we would use them again.\nTravel Business Class at your own peril with Qantas","171":"I'd now stand firm and totally not recommend flying with Qantas.\nAll 4 suitcases to the total family lost and getting any type of human that is not reading off a script is next to impossible.\n\nSo far 4 days without cases and no fresh clothes. More importantly no medical supplies. My wife suffered from various illnesses and meds for 48hrs put in hand luggage the rest in the suit case.\n\nI can see my wife is struggling now as she has been with out medical for a few days.\n\nWe have just got exhausted trying to locate and get answers to our lost baggage.\n\nI think the biggest issue here is the lack of support therefore lack of care from Qantas.\n\nWhat was explained to us as a mild inconvenience of missing suitcases that would be returned the ne t day was a total \" LIE\" 4 days later you can't get an update.\n\nEven customer services put the phone down on us when we simply asked when can someone take responsibility and deal with the issue.\n\nHaving flown to see Family regularly we have always flown Emirates. We saw the TV advert for Qantas over Christmas on tge TV in the UK.. so we gave them ago.\n\nWHAT A BLOODY MISTAKE THAT WAS. \ud83e\udd74\n\nSo right now I'm hand washing our family underware daily with a few basic items bought from Big W ( huge thanks to big W ) just so we can stay clean.\n\nI can wholeheartedly NOT recommend ever flying with the unprofessional service that is Qantas","172":"I am not surprised why Qantas got review only 3.5 and Air New Zealand got 4. Staffs was so rude asked for service 3 times did not care that passenger need to go to toilet. No smile they just want to do there job and that is it. Cancelled the flight 3 weeked before by them we have to book another flight which delay again. Guess what gone for holiday for 9 days still did not get money back. Food was worse than dog food at home. The amount of food less that we give to the spirit on the road. Please don't call beef but called spirit of beef. Pick up our phone and make us waite for 13 mins still did not answer what we want to know. Hang up the phone with out us knowing. Worse airline in the world. Use air new zealand much much better. Change ur mind if u want to book qantas now.","173":"Business class booking, my seat was covered in short curly hairs, pillows and blankets too, food was disgusting, champagne low quality nasty crap. Cabin crew couldn't care less about customers experience.\n\nArrived at Melbourne Airport my Rimowa bag was totally smashed, unable to use the wheels, couldn't take public transport to my families home 150km from the airport due to luggage damage.\n\nI was stuck abandomed at the airport alone a single female traveller\n\nNo choice but to rent a car at the airport which put me out of pocket $500.\n\nCustomer responsibility is below 0.\n\nCompensation offered 5000 Qantas frequent flyer points to the equivalent of AUD$45.00.\n\nThis airline needs to take accountability for high paying flyers, I will NEVER fly Qantas again as a tourist visiting Australia.","174":"Qantas, why double book flights when already filled? No respect for passengers time or lives. ANY other airline operating in or outside Australia would be better to fly with!!\nDon\u2019t book with them","175":"I flew from Brisbane, Australia to Los Angeles to connect with AC flight home to YYZ on March 18 2023.\nThe long haul from Brisbane to LAX is 15 hours and unless you are seated in business, the flight in economy is barely tolerable. Contrary to expectations, as I booked a seat (not free) at the emergency row, the extra legroom made it comfortable and tolerable.\n\nMore importantly, I would like to give kudos to Grady whose friendly demeanor made me feel comfortable and at ease.\n\nI was feeling somewhat stressed regarding the connection in LAX where I had to collect my baggage, check in again, etc. Grady searched out the details I needed to know and I followed his instructions and navigated my way through to the next terminal to catch my connection.\nAdditionally, another attendant named Geraty and Manager ( sorry I didn't catch his name) were so very lovely in alleviating my worries. These 3 lovely people represented Qantas in a manner that the corporation ought to be very proud of. I will fly with Qantas again when I am out this way.\n\nI cannot say enough about how much they raised the bar in customer service standards. Thank you Grady, Geraty and Manager!\n\nAir Canada which is my home airlines could learn a thing or two from Qantas.","176":"Worst check in experience I've ever had. Took almost 2 hours to check in for an international flight because they don't let you do it online. Massive line of people and there's only two flights. Then the total wait of bags was 5 kg over so I'm slapped with a $120 charge. After waiting forever to check in they won't even waive the fee. They looked at me like I was crazy for asking. Also I'm probably 10 kg lighter than the average person on the flight. If we're going to be nazis about baggage weight then maybe considering weighing all the fat people.","177":"During the Covid pandemic, I was promised by Qantas to have my silver member status restored after I had booked a flight that was not registered to my details. However, this has not been done, and I am now a bronze member.\n\nRecently, I requested a new Qantas money card, and I was told it was sent on February 22nd, 2023. However, as of today (March 23rd, 2023), I have not received it, and there has been no correspondence from Qantas about this matter.\n\nWhen I contacted Qantas today, I spoke with a representative named Ray, who informed me that the card has not been sent due to a data issue and that a new card cannot be provided for another two months. I am scheduled to travel overseas in two weeks and need to access my money on this card, so this delay is highly inconvenient for me.\n\nDespite my request to speak with a manager, Ray refused to transfer me and could not explain why the card has not been delivered or why I cannot access my money. He then transferred me to the Qantas travel money department, where I spoke with Sherline, who initially claimed the card had been delivered. However, when I explained the situation, she could not provide any further assistance and transferred me to another department, where the call was disconnected.\n\nA cannot access my own money as they have not provided a replacement Qantas Money card.","178":"Having had a touch of anxiety at Bangkok when Qantas staff could not find my online visa for Australia, I hoped that was a glitch and life would get easier. Not with Qantas. Our luggage was left on the tarmac at Sydney. We had photos of our luggage on the tarmac from a fellow traveller and showed baggage services in Auckland. With a dozen flights a day between the two cities and only 3 hours fly time we imagined it would be a simple problem to resolve. Our baggage was collected by us after a diversion back to our original hotel after 5 days. No contact from Qantas, phones not answered, online tracking not updated, all emails requesting payment of our claim for clothing and toiletries for the 5 days have been returned. Not a care about customers is their ethos.","179":"We used a travelagent to make the reservations. Qantas doen'st like travel agents and will not provide internet services to make even simple changes. I was unable to check-in on line unable to request a wheel chair or a special meal unless I consulted the Travel Agent or made the change last minute at the Airport.\nThe day of the flight I was told I din't have reservations. When I contacted the Travel Agent Qantas had changed the record locator. The record locator is the only way to find the reservations on-line unlike other airlines.\nOn-board service was good. Not sure why they serve breakfast just before a 4 p.m. arrival.\nI took several qantas flights in most cases arrival was on time but delayed because the gate was not available.","180":"Qantas lost our (and others bags). They delivered one bag 5 days later and the second 18 days later (when we were back in UK).\nSince then they ignored everything. 3 customer complaint references have been given. We have been back 3 weeks and all Qantas have done is aske for the same information that has been given at least 5 times, repeatedly and have not even formally apologies for losing the luggage....trying to get the basic level of refunds for the limited amount of expenses incurred (laundry for the existing clothes, toiletries and phones calls) seems impossible. If the flight was in the Europe we could have hammered them, but because it is from a 3rd world country from which they originate, well...","181":"Qantas just do not give a sh*t about its customers anymore. I have been a Qantas Club member and semi regular flyer since Jan 2005.\n\nI had a business overnight flight Bangkok to Syd. I was first customer at the check in desk but I was advised that my allocated seat was broken and could not move or recline. I couldnt understand how every single other seat could be allocated when I was first person to check in (surely not every other bus class passenger has done seat selection online?). Anyway I was offered 500USD as compensation, and given a voucher. Not really adequate for an expensive flight but anyway ...\n\nWorst part is I have called Qantas\n\n22\/11\/22\n13\/2\/23\n13\/3\/23\n16\/3\/23\n20\/3\/23\n\nand still no refund payment or even progress on the matter, I never get called back as promised and there is no email corrospondence avaliable. Their systems are setup to fail.\n\nQantas have really turned me into a \"I hate Qantas\" flyer and now I do everything in my power to aviod Qantas. Unfortunately in Australia other choices are somewhat limited.","182":"Suboptimal customer service.\nTiny meals left us hungry.\n\nOperating like a budget airline at a PREMIUM cost.\nWould not recommend","183":"changed my flight couple of times, and I had to stay in Singapore with my kids overnight, now denying all the record that they have promised with the accomodation and meal allowances, people, just avoid this airline","184":"Clean your aircraft. Steam clean or replace. The seat was filthy, to the point of disgusting. The lavatories had not been cleaned. The decline in this once great airline is appalling. Staff are great, management stinks!","185":"From the moment we got on the aircraft until we got off the staff made us feel welcome and were ambassadors for the airline.\n\nWe booked the seats with the additional legroom by the wing emergency exit and worth the extra fee, just if you get someone who likes to roam around in the dark, as we did, she kept bumping into me and kicking my feet, continuously.\n\nI had the gluten free option for the meals and they were all very nice.\n\nFirst time in doing the non-stop flight and it was brilliant.\n\nThank you Qantas","186":"I used to consider Qantas to be one of the quality airlines but not after this experience. The food was absolutely awful - so bad we did not eat any of the \"'slop\" served on the trans-Tasman or flight from Sydney to Singapore. On the return we opted to eat at the airport to avoid the on-board and were glad we did when we saw to same disgusting meals served to other passengers. The staff who have never been the top in airlines standings but were mostly good, were completely disinterested. The experience in Sydney airport on the return - when our delayed QF2 meant a very tight connection to the Queenstown flight was dismal. Staff on board said not to worry - the flight would wait. A small number of passengers managed to get onto the onward flight - which was then dispatched without the rest of us or anyone's bags on-board! Try to find someone to help - not possible. One staff member at the gate did provide assistance but also admitted there was a disconnect in information as to to what was supposed to happen - and even she did not know. Very poor standards and an airline relying on the Aussie governments pockets to keep in business - not good.","187":"Having flown from Newcastle to Heathrow with BA on my sons passport passport by mistake I arrived at the Heathrow check in desk to go onto Auckland New Zealand.\nIt was no surprise that the check in desk would not allow me to fly until I had my own passport which happened to be 200 miles away at home. Qantas staff ( S.M ) in particular arranged our flights to take place the next day free of charge which was transported down by my family. Even when we went the next day ( S.M ) came to see us before we boarded the next days flight to make sure everything was OK. We missed one day in Auckland but still managed to get our cruise in time. Cant thank the checkin personnel at Heathrow enough.","188":"It\u2019s been over a year, Qantas has made a $1B profit by neglecting their customers and using cheap, unqualified labour in all aspects of the business and we are still waiting for our $400 (chump change to Joyce) refund after multiple phone calls, many hours of stress and 3 times being assured that the refund was transferred (probably hoping we would shut up and go away). Our flight home was cancelled on the tarmac due to engine failure (so much for their doctored mechanical failure stats) they obviously kept the same food as it tasted revolting. We haven\u2019t flown with them since and are reluctant to in the future.","189":"We got this flight to Bangkok...but our luggage didnt (at least one other couple had the same surprise on landing!). We went through the normal , lost luggage \"fun\" at Bangkok airport (filled out forms explained when and where etc and gave our Bangkok address for the luggage to be delivered too, once Qantas decided to send it out.....\n1 piece of luggage arrive 5 days later, the second made it Bangkok the day after we flew home (16 days late). We had to go and buy stuff (underware, toiletries, medicien sun cream etc) and pay for the taxxi to collect our luggage from teh airport!\nIn the mean time I mad over 19 calls to the \"no helpline with little success and emailed and raised complaints.. none have which have had any response.\nI even emailed the CEO - the day after they announced a record profit for the quarter - but he is obviously too busy helping shareholders to worry about customers!\nA complete show or....Dingos.\nSo I have my luggage, at home and receipts and bills for the \"fun\" Qantas caused but as yet no contact and no clear process of how to get a refund for the money spent...we want even talk about compensation for ruining the holiday (and my Wife's birthday!)","190":"Was offloaded from QF009 due to not feeling well was a little stressed but ground staff for Qantas were amazing and got my bag off the flight up to the counter then checked it back in and got me another flight from Melbourne to Perth I was so grateful for everything that they all did which helped ease my stress definitely will continue to fly with an reputable company highly recommend to A++++","191":"We missed our flight because no one bothered to help us with our luggage issues.\nAll the Qantas airport staff would say is that they couldn't do anything.\nWhat good are you then? They looked so disinterested and couldn't wait to fob us off. If your job is customer service, least act like you're interested in helping your customers.\n\nThe only time we got assistance was when Australia Border police helped us, and they had to look over the Qantas staff's shoulders to get them to do their job.\n\nThe Qantas staff promised we would get our luggage in the next airport, and gave us a luggage claim ticket, but when we got to Wellington, our luggage wasn't there. The ticket was just to get rid of us. We would have lost our luggage if it wasn't for a non-Qantas Melbourne airport staff who called us and put our luggage on another flight.\n\nWe will never fly Qantas again, and will not recommend them to any of our friends.","192":"Qantas 717 cabin crew were so lovely. Very professional and friendly too. The plane is a little older but this will be upgraded to the A220 soon. Which then Alliance maybe taking over these type of routes.\nThe flight even though it was short was pleasant, we boarded early and arrived early.\n\nI fly multiple times every week and never really have issues.\n\nYou have to remember they have hundreds of flights every day, the reviews that are negative are usually the ones that get posted. There are many more positive experiences that don\u2019t get added.\n\nWe were provided with free drinks and snacks, crew handed out chocolates after service which was a nice touch. Free beer and wine on evening flights was great.\n\nThank you QantasLink","193":"Upgraded to business this being a longer flight, but there is no meaningful difference, either in seat size nor food and drinks. Staff at boarding were very offhand. Flight crew slightly better. Ground staff were provided by an agency who were very slow.","194":"Booked with British Airways but connecting flight from Singapore was with Qantas. Flew business class but luggage lost in transit. Woman on Qantas desk rude and unhelpful. People at the call centre on the number I was given to phone had no more information than the website which simply said that my cases were being searched for. No one could even tell me if my cases had made it onto the flight from Heathrow. Eventually arrived 3 days later\u2026.\nTalking to others I gather my story is not unusual.\nQantas have made large profits this year but until there is mandatory financial compensation for delayed luggage, nothing will change. We as customers can only vote with our feet-I will NEVER fly Qantas again\u2026..","195":"Qantas canceled the flights. They provided only one alternative option requiring a visa. When I pointed it out, they charged an extra 820AUD to have a rescheduled flight without a visa requirement. But they lost my other tickets. I was trying to persuade them for two hours until I got my tickets back. But these flights were canceled again. You can't speak with someone in Melbourne airport. They say to call the hotline and wait for an hour until a rude operator will refuse to solve this issue","196":"I have not taken my flight yet. It was scheduled form the summer of 2023. I had four flights with Quantas because we are touring Australia this summer. I booked a year in advance and planned every detail. Every flight with them has been changed by the airlines. One flight dropped the second leg of our trip. To make a long story short, I had to cancel everyflight and book with someone else. I had to change transfers, accomadations and exursions due to limited new options. To make it worse, I am now fighting for my refunds, $1000's is now on my credit card due to the delay in refunds. This company is horrible and can not be trusted. I have spend countless hours trying to get their mess fixed.","197":"They don't respond to that customer enquiries I've heard many issues with the ticket no one can help even as gold frequent flyer. That customer service is there to lie to our customers and hope they don't continue to follow up. Absolutely disgusting. Are used to be proud to be a frequent flyer with this airline.","198":"My partner and I are both walking cane dependent and the wonderful Qantas cabin crew of the 737 to Nadi on Feb 26th went out of their way to help make our trip to Fiji all the more special. The food was enjoyable, the flight was seamless (Nicole in particular) greeted us with a very welcoming manner. Thank you Qantas for being the best!","199":"My company booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur to London via Singapore. The KL- Singapore flight was provided by Jet Air , who arrived late but I was insured that the Qantas flight would wait in case there is some delay and passengers to London would be transferred directly to the gate. To our shock the airport assistant announced that the London flight is not boarding anymore and everybody would be transferred to the hotel , but the plane hasn\u2019t departed yet. We rushed to the gate , have gone through the security just to find out the plane is not accepting connecting passengers due to some internal regulations, even though we arrived before the official departure. The obnoxious Qatar gentleman didn\u2019t really care about asking the captain to wait for us. We went to hotel where we were offered 30 Singapore dollars meal a day and a room in a smoky room. I have spent whole night with Qantas call centre who were completely useless and couldn\u2019t move me to another plane this of the following day. Overall the experience was appalling, the service was pathetic and inhumane. The lack of any empathy from Qantas will make me think twice before booking any new flight with this airline in the future.","200":"Disappointed with cabin crew attitude, their body language(I'm gonna do the basics, that's it).\nMy seat did not recline, 2 of them \" flight attendants\" (being asked separately) said \"I'll have a look\" they didn't. Best say: sorry your seat hasn't been serviced, nothing we can do.\nThe beverages team didn't even bother to say what wines were available. It doesn't cost anything to say \" I have only chardonnay and shiraz\". I asked for ice on my plastic cup: the male steward said\" I don't have ice?\nHe was away 20 steps from getting ice...but he couldn't be bothered. Better fly Jetstar, paying LESS for similar service.","201":"Our delayed international flight resulted in us missing our connecting domestic flight additional 6 hour layover at Sydney Airport. I understand this sometimes happens, but the level of poor customer service and lack of care factor was surprising.","202":"A simple non-stop flight from AKL to SYD result in Qantas managing to lose baggage.\nAfter multiple calls and baggage not being located for 3 days they said that we may purchase some clothes and submit receipt through their website to claim back the expense. This was done, and then nothing is heard from Qanats for 3+ weeks. A follow up phone call to Qantas so called customer service line (wait time 20 mins to get through) would not allow me to speak to the baggage department to get me an update, instead they put me on hold for several minutes and then the same lady told me they had \"expedited\" my query. When I asked what this meant and when I could expect a response, I was told, as soon as possible. When I probed this for her to actually give me a time line she would not do it, I asked if I could expect the query to be resolved this year, she couldn't even give me that assurance.\nI paid a bit more to go with Qantas to have a premium experience, this has truly backfired and wish I had gone with Air NZ\/Singapore for my full trip instead, hell even AirAsia would have been better!","203":"Customer service is an art. It comes from the heart. And Qantas, your employees are mastered in that. Thank you Qantas for such a friendly and homley experience during the flight and also at the airport. Thank you Qantas for welcoming me, regardless of my skin colour and passport identity. That was my first experience in 12 years of flying with 13+ Airlines. And last but not least, thank you Qantas for breaking the stereotype that cabin crews should be the slim young human beings with 20 mm thickness make up and an artificial smile. You are showing the world that Cabin crews come in any age, form and shape. That years of experience of them are making you extra special. And their friendly, respectfull behavior from the heart is your identity.\n\nThank you\nAJ","204":"So we tried to book business class from Brisbane to Dublin (Ireland) with our Qantas Titanium card. First Qantas said we would have to book two seperate booking as they can't book non-Qantas flights with Titanium cards! We said that would be fine as long as our luggage could be checked all the way through. They said yes. As it turns out when we called back to confirm, they said its not possible and that we would have to re-check in our luggage at London (Heathrow), even though the connecting flight Qantas booked for us won't allow us enough time to do that connection (While getting our luggage again) - Side note: I can book this all online with zero issues, but Qantas Titanium concierge makes you call to utilise the benefits of the card. We have tried now 6 calls to rectify the issue and at the very least get a flight that allows us to collect our bags on London and make it to the connecting flight. We have been hung up on 3 times. 1 person said they would call us back and nothing and all for the pleasure of $12,000 in flights and $1200 in fees for a Qantas Titanium card. #flyemirates","205":"Horrible experience with QANTAS.! Definitely will not with fly this again.! We travel Auckland-Manila with layover in Sydney on the 22nd of December 2022, and until now one of our check in baggage is still not located and its more than 2 months now.! We check in 2 baggage and the one was delivered last feb.19 around 5am early in the morning without any call or update for the deilvery. The worst thing are the baggage padlock is been cut and tampered and they even put it inside, the zipper is almost broken and heaps of our stuffs is been stolen, as per weigh of our baggage it is mire 26 kilao but before opening the baggage and they weigh in it was only down to 24 kilos.! We keep calling the given baggage customer service number but no one is picking up our call.! Both in manila ang here in new zealand.! I kept sending them an email but no one is replying me and assist me in my lost baggage report and query.! I only got generated automatic reply from them.!\nWe spent our hard earned money on all the contains of our bag.! We pay a more than a 5,000nzd for a one way ticket for me and my husband which is way too expensive for a plane ticket just to experience this inefficient and unprofessional services.!\nIf there is any one who can helps to sue this airline for our lost baggage please help and please advise.!\nEmail me on. mfevangelista.74@yahoo.co.uk","206":"I recently flew with Qantas from Brisbane to Perth with my elderly grandmother (86years). The service produced by the airhostesses has been nothing short of exceptional. They did their upmost to ensure she was comfortable for the entire duration of the flight even to the point They offered her some of their food as she wasn't impressed with the meal she was served. They then even made the effort to help her get to and from the bathroom.\nWe knew travelling with Nan was going to be a challenge due to her lack of mobility but the air hostesses went above and beyond for us and made the trip so much more enjoyable than we had first anticipated. Thank you specifically to Flo, Ali, Amanda and Jasmine.","207":"Much smoother flight both ways. Very little turbulence. Seats not as wide as , Singapore airline or Qatar but good legroom. Plenty of food , drinks and snacks.\nJetlag not as bad as non direct flights to Australia.","208":"No doubt this is the safest airline but the airline crew are so bossy and angry. Not even a smile or being kind. Cabin crew so not feeling welcome on board. Have been on some many airlines before, this is the worst! And of course, the food in a long haul flight, nothing to remember! Give it a try to fly on one of Europe's!","209":"Hands down the worst airline in Australia. Spirit of Australia? Only if Australia is the scum on the bottom of your shoe. The service experienced over 5 flights since the beginning of 2023 has been consistently the worst in the country. Not only is customer service at the check in counter horrendous, but the flight attendants themselves are also the rudest people you've met. On my Brisbane to Port Moresby flights earlier in Jan 2023, they had delays in check-in for over 2.5 hours! All because Qantas decided to reduce staff and switch to an automated check-in system that didn't work and relied on the 5 staff members around to run about helping EVERY customer. Then on my trip back from Nadi to Brisbane through Sydney, I could have easily made my connection but unfortunately I made the misjudgement of going with the \"seamless transit\" service instead of just taking the free airport bus shuttle. They told me I could not make my 2pm flight because the transit desk needed 1 WHOLE hour for domestic connections. So then they booked me onto the 4pm flight, which didn't depart until 5pm! So by the time I reached Brisbane, I was also stuck in peak hour traffic that further delayed my return home. In total, I was delayed by 5 hours with no apology or compensation for my time, only rude service. What a ridiculous excuse for an airline, and claiming to be the national airline of Australia, you bring shame to us all!!!","210":"Qantas failed at every step of the way:\n1. Flight was cancelled - leaving us stranded without airport transport\n2. Replacement flight added a stop over - extra 90min of travel\n3. Replacement flight was delayed\n4. Connecting flight (from added stop over) was missed - extra hour of travel\n5. Lost half of our luggage","211":"(Missing case) I flew from Sydney to Manila with Qantas on 24\/02\/2023. When my partner and I arrived in Manila, there was no sign of one of our cases. It seems that the lady at checkin never checked one of our bags on properly as there are only 3 of 4 bags listed on our receipt, although we handed over 4. We have been trying to get an answer since Friday, we called, we sent several emails, we sent reports, we spoke to live bots, to no avail. We are moving country and all of our belongings are in this case. We are just trying to get an answer and no one is giving it to us. The service has been appalling since we landed at checkin at the Qantas gate of Sydney airport. Staff are just extremely rude and unhelpful! This is supposed to be Australia\u2019s #1 airline?? I have received much better service from budget airlines. Absolute joke. I would strongly advise against choosing this airline.","212":"They lost my luggage and did not even refund the checked luggage fees!!!! CRIMINALS!!!\n\nVery bad customer service, a guy in the Philippenes picked up the phone alwasys who barely spoke English...","213":"I have flown qantas twice in the last 6 months and both times have been terrible - the planes are dirty and seats are damaged or falling apart, the food is mediocre to say the least every flight I have been travelling on has been delayed and or late on arrival with poor communication and reasoning as to why.\n\nWill not recommend to fly with Qantas to anyone well below average service & planes very poorly equipped compared to a competitor carrier e.g Air Nz (much smaller airline) asked for a blanket and was told we didnt load those on but clearly see upper class passengers being served them.\n\nWould much rather pay a higher fare price and avoid them at all costs!!","214":"While I understand bassinet seating is limited. Qantas does not warn users with child bookings that the seat is not in a bassinet row. I had booked seats 25k and 25J (A330-200) which appeared to be the first row directly behind business class, it appears the aircraft has been changed and now the seats are no longer in the spot we expected them to be in. I called the Qantas number on two occasions and was not assisted to rectify this issue. No attempted to rectify the issue and make our travel a lot more comfortable. I have also been informed while on the calls mentioned above, Qantas does not provide airline prams\/strollers for use between check-in and boarding the flight.\n\nPlatinum status has proven not to be useful. My partner and I have no faith in Qantas and have decided to book with a different airline on our return trip and future trips.","215":"5 months ago I changed my return flight from London to Sydney.\nI downgraded my seat from premium economy to economy due to the change of return flight. I was informed I would receive $127 refund for the difference in ticket.\n5 months later after multiple phone calls, written complaints, supplied statutory declarations I am waiting. One person tells me I should get it in 14 business days and the next person has no idea of this. You cannot contact the refund team as they do not have a \"contactable number\".\nOverall I am appalled in the service provided and will not be flying ever again with them.","216":"Flights were delayed and then cancelled with no communication provider. Baggage was delayed for multiple days, the arrived with substantial damage.","217":"The quality of the consumer service is extremely poor, been calling every single day in a week for changing the date, but those agents kept providing mistaken information for the process and the price. You know what the most funniest thing is? Here we come. 4 different prices I have been told to pay for the same thing by 4 different agents. Every single time after the agents process my payment, I received an email informing me the payment is failed . I am very sure there must be something wrong with their system and their staff.\n\nImagine a flight company can\u2019t even manage the system and staff well, how can people trust their planes work?\n\nIf I were you, I would never choose a flight company like Qantas with poor management and potential management problems in the future.","218":"Apart from the luxury of a flat bed, I do not believe that after paying $8,500 return for a business class seat was value for money.\nI have traveeled in business class on Quantas previously and the food and the service was good.\nThis last trip, the food was appaling, threre was nos ervice as after the lights were dimmed the cabin crew disappeared, and I had to walk to the back of econnomy class to find a flight attendant to provide me with some water.\nThe food was dreadful. Neil Perry mat have designed the menu but it was awful. I had a piece of steak which was parctically bouled dry and later a panini with chicken and dressing, the panini was so dry it was curling up, and the filing was non existent .\nI will not waste any more money flying with Quantas.","219":"Absolute shambles. My round trip flights from Wellington to Los Angeles departing on 20th February were voided without my consent.\nI received a text message on 19th February asking me to check in via the Qantas website. When I tried to do so on the webpage using my booking reference. However, it said that I needed to go to the airport to check in.\nOn Feburary 19th, I went to the Wellington airport. Two employees working for the contractor company that works for Qantas at the airport tried to provide me with my tickets. However, they were told by the ticketing department that my flights had been voided. The person in the ticketing department claimed the flight had been voided by American Airlines, their partner airline. On 1 December I was surprised to receive a partial refund of around 177NZD, a fraction of the approx. 1705 NZD I had paid for the flights. This made no sense as I had asked Qantas several times via email and over the phone to specify what the refund was for in November 2022 without receiving an answer from them. In November I had asked them to change my flight date and paid them to process this request. On February 19th, I was asked to call the Qantas hotline as the employees at the airport were unable to help me. To my disbelief the hotline staff told me that they would not reissue the tickets nor provide a full refund.\nI absolutely do not recommend this airline. If you want to make any changes to your flight dates be prepared to spend hours on their hotline if you are flying internationally. I don't wish anyone to go through the saga I am going through with them. I am almost 2000NZD out of pocket because of the mistakes that have been made. I had to book another flight last minute, pay for an additional night at hotel, etc. This has been very stressful and expensive. I still have not received an answer from them nor a full refund and recompensation.","220":"For a national airline, I expected a bit better from Qantas on my 6 hour flight from Sydney to Bali. The food service was ok, very small portion - not enough for a longer journey. The crew were friendly, and the cabin appearance and comfort was fine. However, the in-flight entertainment was AWFUL. Very limited options and hardly any films that are relatively recent, let alone new releases! At one point, I realised that many people, including myself, were watching the same film - Wakanda! During check-in, it's all self check in machines, and hardly any Qantas staff. You have to check in, print your own luggage tags, and take your bags for check in yourself - which I found to be quite cheap from the airline. Qantas also made the passengers on this flight to wear face masks. Why, I have no idea. On arrival in Bali, hardly anyone in the terminal was wearing one, so what's the point?","221":"First time I flew with Quantas and having paid \u00a32400 return economy it was a disgrace. Having got my seat to depart which I was pleased with I was then asked to move as someone more needy needed my seat. On the plus side the staff were really nice and very willing to please. Onboard entertainment wasn't the best but definitely ok. Food was very poor both flights. Snacks not readily available unless you ask. On the return flight I had an email prior to departure advising flight was delayed. Then a further email advising flight delayed again. To their credit they did give me a $20 voucher to get food but that doesn't buy much for a delay of about three to four hours extra when you've already been their nearly three. Then to top it all the flight was delayed from Singapore to UK too which meant I missed my bus home and I couldn't get on another bus as they were full due to a train strike. So ended up waiting for 4 hours to get on a less busy bus. For the money I paid it was just chaos all round and I've since just returned back from Perth and used another airline who were fabulous and cost less than half what I paid for quantas. Unless you need a direct flight use another airline.","222":"You'd be better off swimming to your destination than flying with qantas.\n\nWhere to begin.. this has been the absolute worst customer service I have ever received in my life.\nMy girlfriend and I flew from Melbourne to auckland, we landed but the winds picked up and they were unable to get our bags off the plane. We were specifically told to fill out a paper copy of the lost baggage form and hand this in at the airport, and that we would then receive correspondence about our bags being sent to us within 7 days at the latest.\n\nIt is now day 9 and we've heard absolutely nothing. My girlfriend and I have called every number possible, Sent emails, tweets, direct messages everything but still no one has helped us.\n\nOn the 20th I spoke with someone who put the phone down on me. On the 21st I spoke with someone who told me I'd get 2 calls back within the next 24 hours, 1 about our baggage and 1 about our compensation, i received neither. I called again today and spoke with 3 separate people today on the phone, each one unable to help. Their manager REFUSED to speak to me. I was then refused the name of the manager several times.\n\nIt appears no one in this company wants to help me, let alone is capable of helping me. I have been hung up on twice, I was even left on the line whilst a consultant left the phone on silent for 15 minutes hoping I would just hang up before she had to help.\n\nIn summary, I'd advise anyone looking to fly with qantas to reconsider. They snap up your money (and luggage in my case) and then refuse to help or answer any form of contact after. Utterly disgraceful.","223":"The trip to LA was OK, though the food was mediocre at best. I flew premium economy here.\nOn the return, I tried to change my standard seat selection and was told that even though the seat was listed as free (as was the one I was changing it from), they would charge me $45USD to change seats. I've never heard of this before on ANY airline, and it tipped me back to flying Air New Zealand again from now on. I do like the A380, but not the way Qantas run it...","224":"On the day my wife and I were due to return to the UK from Perth we were \u201cbumped off\u201d the flight I had booked 7 months earlier. The explanation I was given was \u201c safety reasons \u201c due to weather conditions.\nWe were put on to an alternative flight which took off over 4 hours after our original flight and included a 2 hour stopover.Apart from the inconvenience, If we had booked this flight originally it would have cost us much less than the non-stop Qantas flight we had paid for.\nI enquired about the weather conditions with the other airline that supposedly caused Qantas to remove us from the flight. They stated that they were unaware of any adverse weather conditions that day.\nI lodged a complaint with Qantas. who just replied with meaningless and irrelevant \u201cstandard letters\u201d which ruled out any real apology or offer of compensation.\nI suspect that the flight was either \u201cover sold\u201d or took on additional cargo at the last minute. I am waiting from a response from the Australian Airline Customer Advocate .\nI won\u2019t be flying with Qantas again!","225":"Our flight was delayed nearly 30 hours but that is not why I gave 1 star. When we eventually did get underway, the whole experience was terrible. Could hardly move in the seat. Last traveller in my seat left hair clips. We had one meal and 1breakfast on a17 hour flight. Offered water 4 times and twice came round with one chocolate sweet. I had a vodka with meal and it was the cheap stuff. I know, you could go up to the steward station and ask for beverages but on a17 hour flight surely the service could be more frequent. This was my 4th long distance flight in the last 14 months with different airlines and was the worst by a country mile.\nI have also done 2 internal flights with Qantas and they were good, but there certainly should be a little consideration shown to the people who visit Australia. The first impression you get of Australia is the flight and they certainly let their country down.","226":"They charged our card twice and told us they didn't receive any payments so would hold the flights for 24 hours while we called the bank, we spent 6 hours on the phone with them and our bank and the bank confirmed the payment had been approved, so when we called Qantas back the next day to give them the confirmation number and they told us they hadn't actually held the flights and instead had cancelled them. And surprise surprise the flights had gone up by $3500 in a day, how convenient.\n\nThey we're so unhelpful I'm convinced they did all this on purpose and kept saying there was nothing they could do because it was a partner airline. So I would highly recommend you book directly with whatever partner airline your traveling internationally with because we always have issues with Qantas doing this, this was just the most intensely frustrating one.\n\nBy the way Qantas, we don't want another meaningless PR response from you about how sorry you are, we've been on the phone with several of your actual customer service operators and I can tell you, you don't care so just don't reply to this ok.","227":"I have been trying for over a year to contact Qantas. They make it impossible. They will change your booking multiple times so that it no longer makes sense, even after you've arrived at the airport. And I couldn't even use my return portion of the ticket as they had the second leg of the journey leaving before the first -- and from a completely different city! In total I've spent over 30 hours on the phone waiting for someone to pick up. There's no customer care email address. I have written multiple complaints (and requests for refunds) via the complaints and refunds pages, but no one responds. It's a disaster. And to think they have received bailouts from the Australian government using (in part) MY taxes makes me furious. They have even been boasting about turning record profits!!! Yet they can't find the time (or pay sufficient staff) to attend to the valid concerns of their customers. All they care about is money. But this is nothing new with Qantas. When their competition (Ansett) went under just over 30 years ago they instantly tripled all their prices. And they maintain the same attitude today (because they know people don't have a choice but to fly with them or their subsidiary, especially with Virgin going under). The only difference between now and then is that the quality of their service has free-fallen. I went business class and ate half-cooked rice with some unidentifiable meat. We were offered only cheap wine and beer, with no pre-flight drink. Just like economy but the food was worse. My seat and tray were filthy, obviously hadn't been cleaned in a long time, and staff super rude, lazy and not at all attentive (took almost 2 hours to get their attention. They were all huddled in the galley, gossiping. In the end, I had to sit on the dirty seat for two hours, until the seatbelt sign was off, before I was able to walk up to the galley -- they completely ignored the call bell -- and request some wipes to clean it myself). All of this is 100% truth, no exaggerations. Maybe I was just incredibly unlucky, but it's hard to believe that considering the service was consistently bad the whole way through, from beginning to end. If travelling to Australia, go with an Asian airline. They always treat customers with respect; not like annoying nuisances (and I should add, at this point, that I was never unduly demanding and I always spoke to the staff politely and with maximum understanding). Worst of all, Qantas didn't provide accommodation as promised by the staff when they changed the connecting flight to the following day at the last minute, leaving me wandering through dark and isolated car parks after midnight trying to find airport accommodation. The flight attendant probably just told me that to fob me off; she told me to go to the service desk but she must have known it was closed outside of business hours (no one at the hotels was answering and most of the hotels were fully booked. I was not allowed to stay inside the airport as it closed overnight. Such disregard for passenger safety). Really, words cannot express how shocked I was at how far Qantas has plummeted. Australia's favourite airline indeed...","228":"Amazing customer service on our flight from brisbane to Melbourne particular mention to Georgie our cabin crew member made us feel warm and welcome and wanted. Highly recommend clean and top service","229":"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s with qantas and non white people, the customer service is terrible. Despite being an international ticket to Santiago, a leg of my flight Sydney was downgraded to economy. The check in counter customer service rep didn\u2019t acknowledge or tell me the reason why I was downgraded.\nI suppose qantas would have not dared to do this if my skin and hair was lighter.","230":"Five (5) flights in two (2) weeks- two complaints issue against Qantas. Flight cancelled resulted in extra hotel night, no reimbursement. And paid for upgrade to Econ Plus, but Qantas changed planes at the last minute and seated us in Econ.\nQantas gives you a complaint reference number quickly, but then always responds with a\nCall back promise that does not happen. They just wear you down until you give up.","231":"Do what ever you can to fly with an alternate airline.\nOld and cranky stewardess is a prerequisite for Qantas. Try and book a frequent flyer flight on classic rewards. Hahahahaha. Non existent. Their frequent flyer program is so fake. If you can\u2019t find a classic reward flight, which you won\u2019t, you\u2019ll be asked to used the most ridiculous amount of points for your flight. Example, close to 1 million points to fly to London from Sydney one way. That equates to spending 2 million dollars on your credit card to earn those points or flying to Bangkok on a paid flight 200 times. Hard to believe? Check it out. Don\u2019t wast your time until Alan Joyce is gone from the top job. Every Australian I know now hates Qantas. It\u2019s embarrassing to admit it\u2019s our national airline. And all because of Alan. I\u2019d rather row a boat to London.","232":"I flied from Bangkok to Auckland VIA Sydney on Qantas. The A330-300 is a nice aircraft to fly Economy since the a\/c layout is 2-4-2 and the IFE was very nice! The food was great but too small portion while their crew is the best.","233":"My flight was delayed from Friday to Saturday. Bad enough, but it was what followed that really annoyed me. I was told by email that I had to accept the new date and time, even though it was the same flight. Qantas told me I had to contact my travel agent. I spent two calls of 60 minutes with my agent who were told by Qantas that they could not do this. Phoned Qantas again - 28 minute call - seemed to know nothing and told me I had to wait. Phoned just now and was told to wait for another email from them. I don't entirely trust this and I still don't feel entirely confident about being on the flight. Stress\n\nI had to cancel my Melbourne hotel, but it was the totally confused messaging and communication that inspired me to write this. Avoid Qantas.","234":"After my flight was canned due to Covid in 2020, we were issued with 'Flight Credit'. Upon trying to have this refunded, we've been given the run-around for over a year. Customer service either don't care, or don't know. Refund requests go ignored, incorrect information is constantly relayed to us - some go as far as saying previous agents have 'lied' about the status of our claim. I cannot and will not recommend Qantas to anyone.","235":"Food provided was worst I had in any airlines. Crew members were rude tired and overloaded with work. Qantas is totally avoidable for international travel.","236":"Qantas cancelled our flight two years ago and still has not refunded us the hundreds of dollars in excess baggage we paid for. I've spoken to them about this many times, and they don't deny they owe us the money; they just say someone will get back to us about it, and no one ever does.\n\nAny time I phone they say they have no record of any of the hours and hours I've spent on the phone with them before, and need all the information again. If I have a reference number from the last call, when I call again they say the number doesn't refer to anything and they have no record of the case. The worst customer service I've ever encountered, and it's cost us money we couldn't spare - but they really don't care. Avoid at all costs.","237":"Qantas couldn't even get a hotel booking right. The manager in Dubbo luckily rang to decode the Qantas stuff up. They were also holding my credit so no, can't pay for accomodation with that. I will never travel Qantas again so there goes the credit.","238":"My elderly unwell mother in law arrived at airport and was told she has been downgraded from Business to Economy on a long haul flight. Four months later still no refund and unable to communicate with Qantas. Lodged for matter to be heard at Civil tribunal, Qantas turned up with no intention to resolve the matter. They argued that the court doesnt have jurisdiction over Qantas. What has happened to this \"great Australian company\". Surely it time for changes at the top. When is enough, enough!! Please people of Australia and Qantas customers, I urge you not to put up with the state of Qantas!! This is written with regret by a previously loyal and loving customer..:(","239":"Hi\nI\u2019ve booked a flight through Expedia but it states there is no hand luggage allowed on the return flight. Has anyone experienced this before ? ( I am allowed hand luggage on the outgoing flight)\n\nThe concern is how to bring back my power bank. Can I put this in my pocket ?","240":"We had one of our bags badly damaged on a flight in June 2022 and contacted Qantas customer care. After a few emails and pictures they sent us an email in July 2022 staying the replacement bag has been ordered and we will receive it shortly. After 7 months and many emails to Qantas I have no replacement bag and not a single reply from them.\nI called the booking line today and the lady there did a bit of digging and found out my case had been closed and she cannot look into it, she advised me to open a whole new case and reference my old case number.\nSo I started the process all over again, maybe it might get sorted before 2024.\nQantas is a joke and I hate having to fly with them now. We need more airlines to make them wake up and sort out their customer service, or lack of it.\n\nInvoice Number : Case 07016159\nDeparture: Bundaberg QLD, Australia\nDestination: Gove, East Arnhem NT, Australia","241":"My husband & I took QF 735 From Sydney-Adelaide\/1way cost $610 pp at 11:05am 4\/2\/2023 after arrived from a cruise ship. The flight was late. By the time they served lunch was about 12pm.\nWe were horrified lunch was just a piece of cake & coffee\/drinks. For $610 pp. You would have thought a hot lunch or so....... Cutting cost by charging high fare but no decent food service... We think It is unexceptable and quite poorly.\nWe rarely travel economy unless we have to. Qantas needs to shake up the food dept. Reputation is very important if the CEO cares??\n\nBut we had to say the 3 gethlemen flight attendants, they were so polite, professional, attentive & outstanding service. They are our highlights 10\/10 for them.\n\nWe caught morning Virgin business class from Adelaide to Sydney for only $559 pp 2weeks prior. Thump up for Virgin.","242":"Qantas, lift your game!!! Your food on the flight was terrible. No imagination, variety or care went into those disgusting meals. Not hard to get it right. This is not the first time I have had below average meals on one of your flights. Luckily, we took some food with us as a precaution, thank goodness we did.","243":"We had a \/Qantas credit about to expire so chose to go to Bali for 9 days. Our flight took us via Melbourne flying both legs on a 737.\nCheck in at Auckland was flawless and we boarded on time.\nQantas' choice to use a narrow body aircraft for a 4 hour flight to me seemed somewhat concerning. And it was justified, the seats are very close together with knees touching the seat in front.\nThe flight had about 12 empty seats allowing a lucky few to stretch out.\nA bagged meal was passed out not long after seat belt signs went out. It was the same bag for all passengers and included a small bap with some relish and processed cheese wrapped in foil (my partner just got the relish). There was also a blister pack of small crackers with a chutney dip. a bloated packet of banana bread and bag of mini white chocolate cookies. The cookies were very sweet but I'm a sucker for white chocolate so I ate these. I've always been quite tolerant of airline food, it can't be easy to serve meals in flight conditions, but this was just disappointing. I tried everything to see if it tasted better than it looked...but it didn't. It all went back into the bag practically untouched.\nThe drinks trolley followed with tea, coffee, juice and water. If you fancied a wine or beer you were out of luck.\nIt was time to sit back, relax and watch something on the small screen. This must be an old aircraft as the screens appeared very dated. To make a selection required a bit of pressure as the guy behind me kept demonstrating with my headrest continually jolting forward. The selection was limited and it was difficult to find something to watch or listen to.\nI decided to try and get as comfortable as possible on a hard seat with the recline function removed. Comfort was not an option.\nThe staff were very friendly and professional but it was a hard and long 4 hours.\nWe were crossing our fingers that the next leg would be an improvement.\n\nIt was but not by much.\nThe aircraft was practically identical. Cramped, hard seats, poor entertainment system, two toilets for around 160 passengers, no room to get up and stretch the legs....\nThe meal I selected was a beef rendang curry served in a small cardboard box followed by an ice block. They did serve alcohol on this flight.\nOnce again the staff were great, but 6 hours in those conditions was painful and I'm dreading the rapidly approaching day when we have to do the trip in reverse.\nGenerally I quite enjoy flying but I will never repeat this journey. Ever!\nThe bright note to finish...we arrived in Bali on time.","244":"I booked with Fiji airlines who partnered with Quantas for the return portion of the trip.\nDue to covid I was not allowed to enter Australia. To make a long story short, when I went to redeem that portion of the ticket I got the run around so bad to the point that they lied. I finally got through and demanded a refund they emailed me the refund information . I called and was told the refund would take a few hours which didn't make since so I called again and was told 3 to 5 business days then I was told 6 to 8 weeks. That was Dec 20th 2022 it is now Feb 12th and still no refund.....at this point they can take the 1250.00 USD and buy some class this airlines lacks.\nAnd from what I've learned it's company wide.....","245":"I have been very critical of QANTAS of late but to be honest this flight was like the old days, the service was exceptional with crew being super attentive, polite and most of all friendly, I was absolutely surprised to see the return of the breakfast card...nice touch QANTAS.","246":"Even if it meant never flying again I will not use Qantas.Their service is absolutely shocking.I travel with a walking stick and rollator walker which usuallyy means by-passing check-in lines which is a grea help as I cannot stand for very long,so got to Sydney to check in,made to stand in a long queue,the girl at check in had no idea about anything,she wanted to charge excess baggae for my walker which was wron as mobility items are carried free.I advised when making booking that I would need wheelchair to the departure gate ,I waited 1 hour for that.\n\nReturn flight despite them seeing me with my walker I was asked if I could walk up stairs to aircraft....NO.!\nSo arrive hame and collected bagggae then was sent all over the terminal to locate my walker only to find that the basket from the front was missing and when I asked about it the only response was\"I dunno,it's not here\".Ok so put the walker up to leave terminal and it collapsed,it was broken and the front wheels kept collapsing.!\nSo off to baggage claims area where the lady behind counter said\"hang on a minute\" which became 5,then took about 25 minutes to print 2 pages of instructions how to claim damages but only if it was a recent purchase and I had receipts.\nAlan Joyce surew ewarns his money easy.Never Again.\nReally wish I could given no stars.","247":"If you ever want to become an expert in taking a good thing and f*cking it until it can no longer function. Ask Alan Joyce. Qantas is a joke and the Australian parliament should banish them from associating Qantas with the Australian culture.","248":"Messed up flights, cancelled, rescheduled for a day later, delayed etc. Didn't need a transit visa, but due to their delay a transit visa for being in transit in Sydney more than 8 hours was required, was rerouted via Brisbane via Dubai to JHB from Christchurch. Arrived 24hours later. The same happened 2 weeks earlier.\nWill not recommend Qantas ever and surely when flights are delayed a waiver should be applied for transit visa.","249":"Qantas messed up my flight now several times. I needed to change my flight as I was issued the incorrect ticket (I booked a return ticket Brisbane to Delhi, leaving February returning May, and was issued a ticket from Brisbane to Colombo, Delhi to Brisbane instead).. The call centre staff over the phone had trouble understanding this and fixing it, even assuming I had made the mistake myself which is impossible for a return ticket, and also, I never looked at tickets to Colombo at all, it was just a stop over. And I spent hours on the phone sorting it out. The first person said she would reissue the ticket and nothing was done for days. I called back and there was no record of my previous request. Eventually I was given another ticket but it had an overnight stopover in Melbourne due to the ticket I had actually booked being no longer available. I requested to change again as I wasn't told this over the phone but was asked to pay. I change the flight for another day (after 2 1 hour phone calls) and was told it had been changed, was all booked. I didn't check immediately and just assumed it was fine but have found that the ticket has not been fixed, only half the ticket has been booked on the correct date and the previous ticket is still booked in! I have spent genuinely atleast 4 hours on the phone to Qantas and they are very slow to resolve problems. Have never had trouble like this with any airline and expected better from Qantas","250":"Absolute shambles. A small amount of rain and airport closes. Qantas don\u2019t bother to get a plane ready. Provide little information.\nFlight left 2.5 hours late mainly because they didn\u2019t have a plane ready.\n\nAvoid flying with them.","251":"It's been a few years since we flew Business on a trip and previous flights had been a pleasant experience. Not so this Qantas one!\nThe first shock was the Qantas Lounge at Auckland. Decorated in drab, bowling club decor and uncomfortable chairs close together. There were children running around having a great time trying food. As for the food - it was a minimal effort. A soup, butter chicken and rice, salad\/cold cuts, cheese and fruit and a couple of slices.\nThen the flight, 737 800.\nWe compared Business Class with First Class on NSW's XPT train and the train came off best.\nThe train had more space and leg room. The food was about equal. Reheated individual serve meals (choice of two, train of five) of similar quality. Qantas served a dessert of a boxed long-life cupcake whereas the train had good quality icecream and similar cakes.\nAs for service we were offered a drink upon seating and a drink with the meal. When the meal was finished and the clean up, it was time for the attendants to have good gossip with off duty airline staff flying in business for the remainder of the flight.\nThey reappeared for landing.\nDid we think the experience was worth the extra fare for Business Class?\nGood heavens - no, no, no!!\nQantas has sunk to the absolute pits.\nThere is no effort exerted by anyone. They are just putting in the hours for the pay and no one, let alone management, knows or cares.\nSave your money and fly Economy!","252":"As this trip to Sydney was most probably out last treat, we decided to fly business in spite of the cost. What a mistake! The plane was older them me, my seat would not recline, I had great difficulty getting the foot rest down, no TV and my husband had to get out of his seat for me to get past to go to the toilet. There was a drop down TV which, as I am small, I could not see. We were disgusted that there was such an old aircraft on one of the longest flights in Australia.The only saving grace was the delightful gentleman who looked after us. He is the best I have ever had on a flight, in fact, the complete cabin crew were great. We have decided to get rid of our frequent flyer points as we shall never fly with them again.","253":"Terrible service\nI\u2019m travelling solo with 2 kids (2 and 4years old)\nI have bought our tickets just for the fact that I was able to carry 2 extra baby items per kid (car seat and pram). On the booking reservation up until the payment it is specifically written I am allowed but now that I\u2019ve paid and checked my tickets it doesn\u2019t mention those items anymore.\nEVERY single time I called to try to find out , I am told different things.\nIt\u2019s very concerning as when I\u2019m landing I have a car with no car seat !!!!!\n\nNo one seems to want to help or care\n\nMy sister and her baby were supposed to fly with them last month and when she randomly called to check on her baggage allowance they casually told her that they had cancelled their tickets (with no email or text to let her know) 5days before the flight ..!!!","254":"Is it just my imagination or has Qantas deliberately designed its FF flight booking page to be obstructive, frustrating and a down right time waster? Having just spent over 5 hours trying to navigate and search for flights I have come away empty handed again. I then logged into my Singapore Airlines FF account and booked the flights I was after within 15 minutes. No more long haul or international flying with Qantas for myself and family ever again. There is no point showing loyalty to an airline that's has such little respect for its passengers.","255":"I call the 131313 number twice and the assistants confirm in both cases that I will be getting a bassinet for the seat 45E and F.\nThen, a FRIEND of mine informed me about the correct info related to bassinet availability, that it is not available for 45E 45F, but only available for rows D and G.\nI called and confirmed the third time, otherwise I would have been in deep trouble on the departure date.\n\nSerious concern for the qanatas service team as I would have been furious if that were to happen on the day of departure when I confirmed it 2 times with staff.\n\nI hope the headquarters know that customer service team members are not informed about these details, and my friend who told me about this had to call 4 times to fix the same problem.","256":"Ok, I try to calm down while I will.write this review. Probably not very likely. So we flew and had our pram worth 1000-1500 Euros checked into to oversize baggage. We use this pram regularly for my 15 month year old daughter and would have loved to use it couple more years really.\nArrived in Melbourne airport. got the pram damaged back ,bent connection to wheel.aka pram is not usable at all.\nWomen at the tullamarine airport documented all it and said Quantas have someone in frankston he could fix it. He said he can't cause he doesn t have the brand of my pram. Then every single week I made a customer call to Quantas about any information on what to do because I like a refund or solution really.\n1. They could not find the case number the woman gave me from the airport. Then a new one was created. Saying someone will contact me back.never happend.\n2. Week after I called back ..took ages to find out my new case number ..and then they realized this new case number was not assigned to an agent which is why nobody responded for a week . But now they will contact me within 24-48 hours they said with this new case number.\n3. Nothing happend for a week.called back .after another 30 min on the phone it was found out that the wrong department was it referred to. And now they contacted customer service which is only reachable via chat from the department I called (??) Wtf..\nThen they said they defo call me back but I will have to provide evidence or proof.\n4. Nothing happend for a week again.\nGetting an email today for my case saying they are not liable for any damages on baggage .\nThanks for nothing Quantas\nThe most appaling customer service ever.\nWhat happens to my damaged pram??\nUnbelievable in times like these.\nThe worst is ,you can't contact anyone.everybody has excised but no solutions.\nAbsolutely gutted.\nTrying to avoid them","257":"Over 12 months, still waiting for refunds. Overseas so called \u2018service centres\u2019 have no idea what they are doing.","258":"I have been trying for over seven months to get a refund for accommodation after Qantas canceled a flight. I have contacted their Customer Care team innumerable times and have been told multiple times that either a) I will be reimbursed within 5-10 working days, or b) someone from the team will call me back to tell me the status of my refund, or c) it will be escalated immediately. NONE of this has happened. I have wasted so much of my time and energy trying to get what is owed me by a clearly untrustworthy company. Furthermore, there seems to be no way to contact their head office directly. You always end up talking to someone at a call center outside of Australia. They clearly don't give a toss about their customers!","259":"I bid Au $3200.00 for an upgrade to Business class but was not successful so they upgraded me to Economy Plus .\nI did not want economy plus as I had already payed for exit row extra room . I flew regular economy expecting a refund . Qantas refused and refused my appeal .\nWorst customer serv\u00eds will never fly Qantas again I am out $3,200","260":"We were on a trip to New Zealand and had to urgently re-book flights back to Perth as a family member was seriously ill.\n\nThe lady I spoke to originally was incompetent. She messed up our email addresses so that we never received a confirmation of the flights or an e-ticket. She did not record our Frequent Flyer numbers which would have helped a lot and also got my wife\u2019s name completely wrong. The lady was obviously not in Australia and there was a lot of noise in the background including both children and chickens!\n\nAll the above necessitated another call and long wait to resolve this issues which i could seriously have done without!","261":"I can\u2019t believe how staff can be so different within the same organisation. We flew domestic a week ago, my husband being a frequent flyer we use the business lounge. Sydney domestic lounge staff super helpful and nice!\nSydney international lounges totally opposite. We encountered two crusty old employees that need binning! Miserable, self righteous jobs worths.\n\nTotally puts you off favouring the great Australian airline.","262":"Customer service is terrible, had to wait 50min to get someone on the phone, terrible experience. Want a serious refund. had 4 flights in stead of 3. with one plane to late and my loguage was lost","263":"Disgusting customer service! I had to cancel return flights to Sydney in 2020 due to Covid lockdown. I requested a refund as when we booked new flights a year later we were told that had to pay cash for the new flights and to seek a refund for the cancelled flights. I have been ringing and emailing Qantas for 8 months with no refund in sight. They keep asking for the same information each time I call. I have been told many times that the refund has been authorised and will be paid within 6-8weeks. What sort of banking system do they use, Pony Express? Someone please show them how to use EFT. I have also asked for my non payment complaint to be escalated several times. I have been contacted by Qantas Customer Service several times and not only told me my refund will be investigated but blatantly lied to in emails advising that the refund has already been paid. After checking every bank account confirming that this was not the case. In my latest contact with QCS today I was asked for the account number from which the tickets were paid to allow them to refund the money. This information has provided to them in writing several times going back several months and every time I am told I will have to wait 6-8 weeks from the date of my enquiry for the refund to be paid. I have totally lost my patience having been waiting for my refunds for 8 months and any respect I have had for Qantas and I am now lodging a formal complaint with ACCC. This whole saga has taken up many hours of my time, often being kept on hold for more than an hour. My next course of action will be to write directly to Alan Joyce. I have given Qantas one star because that is the minimum but they don't deserve it.","264":"The air hostess were rude, rolling their eyes when i asked about nuts in the food due to anaphylaxis to tee nuts.\n\nWe arrived an hour late to Sydney airport. We waited at the baggage carousel for 2 hours with no updates only to be told that Qantas had lost everyone\u2019s from our flight luggage and to lodge a lost baggage claim.\n\nI called Qantas multiple time thinking it was an Australian Airline but everyone i spoke to was overseas. I was told they had located my bags but i had to wait for the phone call from the team at Sydney Airport.\n\nI called back 2 days later to be told no sorry your bags have not yet been located.\n\nI am unable to talk to anyone no one can explain why a whole planes luggage has gone missing !\n\nWe have all of our clothes in the bags and cannot afford to buy new clothes, Qantas simple don\u2019t care as long as Money is their pocket!\n\nI will never fly or recommend anyone to fly Qantas again!","265":"This was the first time me & my hubby decided to travel by Qantas airways. The beginning of our journey started with a sour taste. The entertainment didn't had much options. The food was okish. I must say the staff on QzF 153 was amazing they looked after our needs with a beautiful smile. A big shout out to Gemma Suales, Isabelle Dick, Kristine Wasnett, Sally Johnston, Richard Boyne.\nOn another Qantas flight Brooke and Chantelle gave us five star services.\nThey all deserve a praise with a big raise cheers guys \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\ude0b\ud83e\udd42","266":"I am a faithful Qantas Silver Member who booked some very expensive Christmas Domestic Red-E tickets from Syd-Adl ($1814) and failed to realise I had booked both tickets in my name. I immediately called customer service to change the other name to my partner's but as it was a Red-E ticket it wasn't possible. The Customer Service agent said it was possible to get a refund or at least a flight credit on cancellation so we went ahead with that and borrowed extra money to buy two more tickets at a similar price (now $3600 down on my bank balance). I was refunded the taxes only ($56 each) and after more than 9 weeks of waiting I have been told \"Its in the T's and C's of the special fare\" that you cant change anything so there will be no refund. This is a situation of passing the buck by Customer Service to not tell us they wont refund anything (we could have at least kept one ticket in my name) and of scandalously unfair conditions for wanting to simply change the name on the booking. All tickets were cancelled and repurchased on the same day - Qantas couldn't care less. In an email they said they could send a letter of the dispute for my travel insurance but on reply they had already closed the case number and I could get no further response. Appalling corporate behaviour, oblivious to the actual situation of wanting to change the name under the \"Same day, no mistake \" policy they have. Beware - they say you can change your ticket up to 24 hours - BUT if its a Red-E deal they don't mention you forfeit ANY kind of refund or credit.","267":"At the last minute, about to board our flight from LAX to Australia, my teenage daughter got sick. Qantas put us up (two rooms) in a hotel near the airport, even though we had flown to LA on a separate itinerary. They changed our tickets, and they changed our daughter's ticket three times until she was finally well enough to join us in Oz. As if that weren't enough, we had booked the least expensive economy tix, and they flew my teenager business class. Every time I called to make yet one more change they were nothing but empathetic and helpful, calling in the manager to make necessary alterations, all without a single extra charge. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f","268":"I was due to travel from Brisbane to Auckland in December. I was unable to get on the flight due to becoming unwell with mental health issues. I had bought a refundable ticket - therefore I am eligible for a refund\u2026 however Qantas for 8 weeks now are causing me nothing but stress and upset. The booking was made through a travel agent to begin with but was altered directly through Qantas - and paid to qantas direct - however they are saying I have to go through the travel agency to get my refund \u2026 but Lastminute.com are sending me back to qanatas saying they can\u2019t be any help now the departure date has been but also due to the fact qantas we\u2019re the ones who changed my flight \/ took my money. The both agree i\u2019m available for a reason but both are refusing to help me sort it and keep saying they can\u2019t do anything it\u2019s down to the other person. I even spoke to someone in Brisbane at the desk who made a note on my account saying please make the refund. This has gone on for 8 weeks, about 15 phone calls to both companies but still not getting any further. Qantas promised to ring me back on Saturday with the manager but did they? of course not. Nothing but disgraceful. So I continue to fight the battle to try and get my refund.\n\nI am a 23 year old girl suffering from mental health issues, was unable to fly due to medical reasons and now they are causing me nothing but more stress and anxiety. Would never use Qantas again.","269":"Having successfully entered a ballot for an upgrade on our flight to Hobart, we travelled Business class one way. The flight was full but left on time with minimum fuss and arrived 10 minutes early. Our bags were coming through as we reached the baggage collect.

In other words a perfect flight - from leaving out hotel in Hobart to home in Sydney's north in under 4 hours!! Congratulations Qantas.","270":"Flight cancelled. No prior info. Got up at 4am to catch the flight. Upon check in I was asked to wait aside after Auckland airport was flooded. I could not go to Blenheim my final destination. All my bookings (accommodation, flights, car rental, tours, wine tasting\u2026)were lost and all Qantas employees were just careless repeating that the airport was shut after the flooding and that it was not their fault\u2026.like if it was my fault! I paid to be taken to Blenheim and got taken to Christchurch and it seems that I should be satisfied with that even if I had to-rebook and spend accomodation there.\nI was offered to go to Christchurch instead of Blenheim (4 hours drive from Blenheim) had to wait 4 hours at Sydney airport and I was not even offered to access Qantas lounge waiting for the connection!\nAnd no need to say that this trip was one life time journey since I am coming from Europe spending 2 months travelling between Melbourne, Sydney, Tasmania, New Zealand and the Gold Coast.\nA true unacceptable way of dealing with customers.

I have business class tickets. I got told at the quantas lounge at Perth that I will not be permitted to enter even though I have a business class ticket because I have flip flops on. Apparently I need closed shoes. Why was I not informed of this policy when making my booking? I've travelled extensively and have never experienced such a policy before. When travelling long distances or many legs on a trip being comfortable is a top priority and flip flops trump closed shoes any day. I will avoid Quantas in future as my ticket paid for that lounge visit that I was denied.","272":"My husband is still in much pain after the stewardess on our Qantas flight hit him several times with her cart while he was asleep. Each time she hit him he was awoken to pain as she slammed his knee and hurt his hip. She was not apologetic at all. We now have seek medical attention in a foreign country.\nIf this is how this airline treats their customers I am going to avoid them from now on.","273":"Check in was a mess, no longer can you simply enter your locator but need a boarding pass for scanning. A helpful member of staff attended to this for us. Amazingly the food, wine, seating & service were all excellent for a 737, despite what tricks the lousy CEO gets up to.\nThe people make the business & this was true of the cabin crew.\nAt least our bags arrived with us, BUT, followed a whole heap of Econ luggage. That is what happens when you contract out workers Mr Joyce MSc, Master of Sneaky Cons. from the RyanAir University no doubt!","274":"No Way To Plan With Qantas\n\nI am very saddened by the quality of Qantas Airlines. I had my flight from Auckland (AKL) to Cochin(COK) via Sydney.\nLost my bags between Sydney and Banglore and had 7 hours delay for the return flight from Melbourne.\n\nIn-flight travel was clunky and rattling with an antique in-flight entertainment system that is barely functioning.\nThe aircraft was old and once again we are paying a premium price for a budget service. The QANTAS brand is no longer appealing.\nMeals on Qantas is absolutely embarrassing, more likely to die from the plane food than an aviation crash.\n\nYOU SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF, UP YOUR GAME QANTAS !!!","275":"Terrible experience - Does not inform that people from Vietnam need a transit visa even if just staying for 2 hours in Sidney.

I don't know if the staff felt our sentiments. We have all our kids essentials in there including their medicines and supplements and all my clothes and shoes for my work commencing 30th, Monday.

The flight was cancelled and changed into another flight with transit via Singapore.\n\nSo a simple 4 hour flight turned into a much longer flight while travelling with 1 infant and 1 kid. Our return flight now took 18 hours! No compensation was offered whatsoever!\n\nIssue #2: The flight that departed from Perth to Singapore was delayed by 1-2 hours. This caused a very short amount of transit time in Singapore. Because of which our luggages were not able to be carried through to Jakarta, so we landed in Jakarta without luggage.\n\nIssue #3: On the return ticket, the flight was delayed by 2 hours. Now our flight landed in Perth at 2:30AM instead of 12:30AM. Again this is very frustrating, especially when travelling with 2 small kids. Again no compensation was offered whatsoever.\n\nI can't believe so many things went so wrong in 1 booking?!\n\nI have been accumulating Qantas points for years now and I plan to spend all that away and never do business with Qantas again if possible.

Again, long delay in getting baggage when I arrived in Melbourne, not sure why my bag didn't arrive first, so much for having them labeled priority.","281":"I used to fly with Qantas for many years and they changed to be the worst company in recent years!\nI booked a multi-city flight from July - October.

However, I still haven't received the refund.","282":"I know it is a national pastime to have a go at QANTAS at the moment but our trip to Japan and Hawaii, flying JAL, Hawaiian Airlines and QANTAS put it into perspective. Yes, our QF was 40 minutes late leaving Honolulu because of a broken toilet, and some of the charging facilities in our seats didn't work. But - they actually communicated what was happening, they made up the time, they communicated to people with potentially impacted connections and there were on ground service staff to deal with any outstanding questions. None of those were in place for Hawaiian Airlines. And atleast there were charging facilities in the seats. Not so JAL. Nor did JAL have the headrests that bend around your head to support you while sleeping. Only QANTAS offered a pillow and blanket to everyone onboard, regardless of what you had paid for your seat. QANTAS offered excellent food choices - the others either offered nothing or no choice at all - just slapped the hamburger patty on top of the reheated frozen three veg on the tray in front of you. QANTAS offered plant forward and two meat options. They provided dessert for every meal. Chocolate treats. Fresh salads. Warm garlic bread. Gin and tonics for each meal service. Craft beers, again regardless of your class of flight. Shortest wait for some time for baggage. Engaging and friendly staff.\n\nThis is probably a little unfair for JAL as we flew shorter trips and the point isn't to criticise them. The point is that QANTAS stood tall. They weren't perfect. But neither is anyone else out there. They got all the basics right and had a few unexpected nice surprises to add.","283":"Qantas is doing a great job on this service\nRecommend the A330. The flight on time.\n\nBetter than jetstar","284":"We waited for over a year for our holiday which included a business class airfare to Singapore. As a first for us, we were very excited. Five minutes from the airport we got text saying delayed 2 hrs. We had arrived three hours early as told, so now a wait of 5 hours. But thinking we at least have the business class lounge all should be good. The lounge was packed with little options for seating. We ended up at the far left side of the lounge. The only food station (one only for all the passengers) was on the far right side of the lounge. Food available was three hot dishes (rice, butter chicken and soup). All luke warm. Cold offerings was lettuce leaves, cold slaw, quinoa and rice salads, all pretty bland and boring. Bread rolls with butter. No butter after two hours. Two cakes for sweets (Sara Lea carrot cake and can't start to describe the other but stale and hard). One coffee station. See attached photo's. Our plane was then delayed a further two times with boarding from 5.10pm actually being 10.20pm. The food offerings did not change during that 5.5hour wait. Once boarded, the staff were very good, but all the excitement of being on business class was gone, tired and not interested in eating dinner at midnight.","285":"I am flying first morning Qantas flight #605 from Brisbane to Melbourne in business.\n\nVery solid airport experience with premium entrance, secure check and lounge in the same dedicated business class wing.\n\nLounge is not cramped, barista coffee, basic breakfast, but tasty croissants and fresh juice from a wide selection of fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe 20 y.o.

Super upset with Qantas. If ur airline commit the freeze facility please take in writing as staff is super rude and don\u2019t care of neither 1000s dollars injection nor well beings of person. No sympathy for special needs customers.\n\nAlso, they skipped my breakfast and haven\u2019t severed and when I told they told me that we don\u2019t have anything for vegetarian whereas I saw that Ido was served to other customers as well as haven\u2019t provided proper food for dinner, snacks and lunch is just boiled veggies with no spices and salt. Extremely poor Service of staff. Staff asked me to eat chicken whereas I already told that I requested strict vegetarian meals (jain).\n\nThird thing is miscommunication, I booked the flight and then they changed it so I called customer service that 50 mins will not be enough to change the flight from international to domestic flight whereas they clearly told that it\u2019s enough as I don\u2019t have to take luggage and immigration clear which was denied at checkin so required to change the flight in last minute which was big hassle.\n\nThis is so much upsetting.","287":"Flight Adelaide to Melbourne, a bottle of red wine was smashed in our luggage, despite being well packed and previously arriving intact from other flights.

For boxed coffee pods to be damaged one has to presume the luggage was not handled with great care. We have not flown Qantas for decades and have just resumed (after vowing never to do so again), and have further upcoming flights next year; we do hope things improve","288":"Check in staff in Singapore brilliant, boarding okay, flight smooth but cabin service very low standard - as though the attendants would have preferred to have an empty plane","289":"Arrived at the airport for a long haul trip to Santiago from Auckland only to be told by a Qantas staff member that the trip had been cancelled the day prior. Not a single email, nothing from Qantas about the cancelled trip. How hard is it to send an email telling someone their flight is cancelled???!!! Was so profoundly baffled by the incompetence.\n\nWas told I'd be on the 1pm flight the following day. Decided to ring to make sure and ask for an email detailing the new flight only to find out that I wasn't actually book on any new flight. Took 40mins to sort out a new ticket. Then when I mentioned that I'd paid for a specific seat I was told it would be in a similar seat only to discover i had been alocated a middle seat - the type id paid to avoid.\n\nHonetly f#@$ this airline. It's a pile of manure.\n\nManagment has driven it into the ground.","290":"Qantas used to provide a good service, with passable customer service. Their app was poor and the integration of service between website and app was lacking.\n\nThis time round, I booked but the website made an error. I was due to fly in two days and spent 5 hours on the phone before someone in customer service took my call. It was enormously frustrating.\n\nI would recommend anyone avoid Qantas. The customer service is insulting to my time, and they have a duty of care to provide a service which they did not fulfil.","291":"You are the most expensive domestic airline to fly with in the world and you have no respect for your paying passengers. Diverting direct flights to other aiports after clients have paid such high prices to fly direct is a disgrace Shame On You and the person at the top who is on one of the highest salaries in Australia - you have turned into the worst airline in the world to deal with and you used to be the best.","292":"Worst flight ever! I\u2019ve traveled a lot and the crew experience was dreadful . There was zero interaction between the crew and ourselves. There was only a veg option when they eventually got to us . Asked for milk ,as she forgot to give it to me was told she\u2019d get to me , was virtually thrown at me . The young blonde in particular obviously didn\u2019t want to be there. The flight out from the Uk was ok but I think Qantas standards have dropped since we last used","293":"Was put onto this flight last minute after our original airline cancelled then screwed up the new booking. The customer service at Qantas was above and beyond at every step of the journey. Thanks.","294":"Canceled our flight by text on arrival and change our flight to Sydney then to Melbourne arriving 3 hrs later. No care factor at all. We were ok and asked for similar seats row 7 yes sir. Well 30 is the last row and yes that was it. Check luggage in and went to charge us $100 per bag, spoke to lady sorry I\u2019ll fix, still would not scan baggage label went to a guy and he was good and found out she booked our bags just to Sydney and not all the way to Melbourne and I double checked this with attendant. Just no sorry as if is the normal we have travelled for years with Qantas being gold for most of the time than silver now bronze. Well if we as a family have a chance it will not be with Qantas or Jetstar you Have no care factor at all. A simple sorry here is a voucher for your next trip. Bye","295":"Myself and a family of two young kids stuck in Singapore airport for two nights ... I have booked the direct flight through Qantas from Brisbane to Bangalore which has Malaysian Airlines connection between Singapore and Bangalore ..\n\nIt's all started here .... Our jouney from Sydney - Singapore has delayed by an hour and half.... Reached Singapore at 7.30pm on 1st of December 2022. Our connection flight from Singapore to Malaysia was at 7.30pm and the ground staff has advised it's been cancelled ... Around 10 families were gathered and ground staff were trying to solve the issue (Please note when I checked the email later I observed Malaysian airlines which is the cancelled connection as per quantas sent me an email about their delayed start at 8.30pm but I have not received any email regarding their cancellation of flight\ud83d\ude44.. So I doubt it's cancelled.)\n\n[07\/12\/2022, 11:27 am] Rijesh KV: Ground staff spoke to us arranged flight for us .. Wrote in a paper next day's flight details.. I have asked them for tickets and booking .. They said its all booked and Sent us to hotel.. This was our first experience and we believed them.. and there was other people as well..\n[07\/12\/2022, 11:34 am] Rijesh KV: The first day first half was great.. The accommodation was good, food was good.. We left after lunch to airport for the 22:55 flight. First thing we did was to call the customer care and confirming the flight details are right... After calling about an hour they have been connected and advised us the flights are good to go tonight.. I asked them about the tickets and there is no update in the Qantas app... They did not have any answer... Luckily I saw the Qatar airways counter check in and checked with them our flights at 22:55 (Please note our connection they have arranged at 22:55 was from Singapore to Doha and Doha to trivandum India through Qatar airways)... That's where I got the first shock... The flight already departed at 10:55 and the ground staff did an error informing it as 22:55.. I could not believe how the customer confirmed our flight an hour ago when I checked them...\n[07\/12\/2022, 11:41 am] Rijesh KV: Hereafter I have got a clear picture of how bad the customer service and Qantas system for customer support... The major cause of this issue is they don't have a system in place when flights cancelled .. As a customer I did not get a ticket or even the app was not updated , so that I could not check for their mistakes... (Another weird thing happened is someone else in my hotel who became a good friend of mine later had a Singapore Bangkok flight booked.. That popped up in my app, theirs got automatically cancelled ... Later I understood actually ours should be cancelled , not theirs... Pathetic system.. Those guys even got our luggage when they requested luggage , luckily they knew us and let us knew)\n\nThe situation became bad and I was worried as the young kids of 4 & 9 are with me .. The customer care did not worry about the accommodation .. I kept on calling the customer service .. An hour to connect and tell the whole story.. After couple of hours they booked a flight (they said) and advised us they will send tickets.. I don't have to call them.. I lost my belief on them , called once more and confirmed booking ... They said they will send an email confirmation after tickets issued.. Asked about my accommodation, they advised they will pay 200 dollars for overnight stay... Singapore is a costly city, a 200 dollar accommodation will never be good also its a last time booking ... Anyway we did not have any choice... went there .. had our half sleep.. Early morning 4am checked for emails .. No tickets.. Called the customer care again... One hour of call to repeat the story.. It took another couple of hours to get the tickets sent to us...\n\nFinally we went to airport after two nights staying in Singapore.. We were all exhausted.. Got srinlankan Airlines to Colombo then from there to Bangalore (India)... The root cause of the problem is their manual handling of these issues, not proper updating of the system... Hope no one will have these issues in future... After all these issues, our return flight from Bangalore has got auto cancelled and had to book again..","296":"Qantas make a big splash on their booking page regarding a 24 hour cancellation promise. This works if you're paying with cash or points but beware they will rob you of your Qantas pass value with this process. This is a major gap in your process Qantas - the customer service staff have no process for this either and could not explain whether I'd ever see my funds again.","297":"It was OK. Seats a bit uncomfortable. Food was pretty decent. Flights on time. Nothing to shout about though!","298":"Flew from Sydney to Perth Business class seat 4A and i must say I travel a lot of miles on lots of airlines and this would have been the best Domestic Business fkight I have ever been on. The cabin and lavatory were clean, the staff were engaging and friendly, the food was excellent and great choices and the drink service and choice was also great. It made a 5 hour flight very enjoyable and a pleasure to fly with a great airline.","299":"There should be a zero for this airlines. They don\u2019t even deserve 1.\nTravelling with 13 people in business class and being served with a set menu in a restaurant at the airport , as qantas has no lounge. Worst airlines with no one to listen. I lost my baggage from my flight from melbourne to delhi to start off with and then this experience at the airport when flying back, with passengers on wheelchair, children and an infant. Please save your hard earned money , so you don\u2019t feel wasted. To add to your dilemma and disappointment there is limit on food and drinks. And no tea and coffee","300":"Flew into Auckland on Saturday and my luggage was left in Melbourne, it's now 3 days after my arrival and still no luggage and cannot speak to anyone about it. Terrible service will not use again.","301":"Arrived at airport and was told business class was full and we must fly economy. Qantas havent followed up and three months later we are still trying to get a refund. If something goes wrong with them there is no means for recourse. Steer clear!","302":"Flight was delayed overnight and we were told to get hotels. We were both told and given a letter saying we would be reimbursed for expenses. A month later, 20 emails, phone calls - no response and $1000 out of pocket. Incredibly disappointed in Qantas","303":"We paid a premium price to fly Business Class from London Heathrow to Melbourne with a short stop over in Perth before boarding the same plane to complete our journey to Melbourne.\nOn arrival in Perth we were \u201cbumped\u201d off our plane .\nOur plane was hijacked for a return flight to London .\nWe waited for over 6 hours for a plane from Melbourne to complete our flight.\nWe eventually arrived in Melbourne 7 hours late .\nWe have been flying to Melbourne for 15 years what was going to be our shortest flight was the longest we have ever experienced.\nWe have been trying to claim our legally entitled compensation from Qantas since September 14th 2022 under EU \/ GB legislation ,\nThey have been totally obstructive and impossible to deal with and no apology for our 7 hour delay .\nWe have now taken the matter up with the CAA .\n\nDo Qantas have a Customer Care Service Department ??\nIf I ran my business like Qantas and treated my customers in a similar manner I would go out of business !!!\nHow long will Qantas last !!!!","304":"Qantas cancelled my connecting flight from Vancouver to Sydney Australia while I was at the boarding gate at Heathrow (21st Dec), giving me no alternative but to get on their partner airlines (Air Canada) flight without knowing what would happen when I arrived at Vancouver.\nAt the Qantas desk, I and other passengers were told by the Qantas staff that we were rebooked on a flight on the 23rd Dec. then they handed us a \u2018disclaimer\u2019 sheet saying that as it\u2019s a weather related cancellation, they would NOT provide accommodation\/food or transport. It was minus -9 and we were told \u2018claim off your insurance\u2019\nWe were able to find out online that there was an Air Canada (PARTNER AIRLINE) flight leaving later that night to Brisbane, so we asked if we could be put on that.\nThe Qantas supervisor was adamant that the airport was shut down and NO flights were leaving (incoming only) and had been like that for the previous few days! - again, if so, then why were we allowed to depart Heathrow & not placed on a different route to Sydney??\nAfter several hours of strong discussion with the Qantas staff about the fact that there WAS a flight leaving Vancouver for Brisbane and requesting (and failing) that a more senior Qantas representative be present.\nI asked for the supervisors name (Jane) and insisted that she get her superior on the phone. She said he wasn\u2019t picking up as he was on vacation!!\nI asked her for his name and she said he was called Bill as I wanted the person (Bill) reports to, to come speak to us stranded passengers.\nEventually after SEVERAL hours and insistence that Jane keep trying to go up the Qantas chain of command until we speak to someone capable of resolving this issue (still no word from Bill) - miraculously, there was an Air Canada flight leaving that night for Brisbane and we all found seats on it!!\nTurns out, that there were so many spare seats that people were lying across three seats able to sleep!\nSo WHY did Qantas put us passengers through this??\nIf I\u2019d meekly accepted their disclaimer sheet I\u2019d have been stranded at Vancouver and missed my family reunion for Xmas in Sydney.\nWorst customer service experience EVER.","305":"We have not Flown with Qantas for more than 25 years and were looking forward to the Flight . We were returning to Sydney after our Journey to Perth on the Indian Pacific . We had a few Dramas with the Booking with our first Booking being Cancelled by Qantas and then being Booked on a replacement Flight which was not convenient for us as it meant we had to be at the Airport around 6am . We chose a mor appropriate Flight and rang Qantas to secure this Flight . That was changed without too much fuss and then they tried to charge us Extra Money for changing the Flight . I reminded the Lady that it was Qantas that Cancelled the original Flight . She put us on Hold for about 30 seconds before coming back and informing us that the Fee would be Waived . We arrived about 2 and a half hours prior to our flight . Check in was by way of Machines . I could not get the thing to work so I contacted a nice gentleman in a Qantas Uniform and he took us to his Computer Terminal and checked us in there , we were then shown to the Bag Drop area to drop of our cases . We were now ready to go through security .\nSecurity completed we went to find our Gate No 12 . As we waited and the time for our Departure was getting nearer , the Plane had not yet arrived at our Gate .\nApproximately 10 minutes before our schedule departure time the plane arrived . An Airbus A330 \/ 200 . We have flown on one to Bali with Garuda . They have a 2 - 4 -2 Configuration in Economy . Our Seats were 55 J & K , Window & Aisle .\nBy the time we had Boarded and the Doors Closed we were 30 minutes behind Schedule . Taxying only took a couple of Minutes and we were soon on our way to Sydney . The Captain came on the speaker to announce that we had a good Tail Wind and the we should arrive in Sydney ahead of Schedule . Good Luck rather than Good Management .\nCabin Crew came around with Meal service , a choice of Chicken Salad or Slow Cooked Beef Ravioli . We both chose the Beef Ravioli . The Meal was served in a Cardboard Box with Wooden Knife & Fork which were absolutely useless . The Knife could not cut Pasta and the Fork just bent with the slightest pressure .The Ravioli was supposed to have a Tomato Sauce. This was non existent ., with not even a Trace of it . The Pasta was so Dry it was devoid of all Moisture and was the consistency of Cardboard . The filling could have been anything as it had NO flavor at all .I was hungry and tried to eat it however I gave up after 2 pieces . It was disgusting . The Cabin crew came around with drinks and we both had a Beer . After finishing our Beers we were asked if we would like another , which we did . The Cabin Crew were good , both Friendly and attentive . Soon we were descending into Sydney and were at the Gate by the Scheduled arrival time . There was a delay of about 20 minutes before our Bags were on the conveyor . The Flight was OK , The Cabin Crew were great . The Initial Booking was ok but Qantas managed to cause an upheaval which the did fix . I hate Self Check in . The Beer was Good The Food was Disgusting and Qantas need to do much Better than serving Food like this .","306":"there were many of us on our flight who's baggage was not put on our plane and after the plane with the baggage finally landed, it took over 6 hours for it to actually arrive to my hotel (which was 20mins from airport). terrible service, was not accomodating and no baggage department to call to chase up the issue.","307":"As my national carrier I am very saddened by how the quality of Qantas has dropped over the last few years. We visited UK for Xmas and booked Qantas, going over we were put on Emirates flights. The first issue was not being allowed in Emirates club despite being a Qantas club member. If you book an airline and they bump you to someone else you should be able to have the same paid for privileges! As it turned out the Emirates flight was great. lovely staff, comfy plane , very good food and snacks. Coming back we came Qantas on the long haul from London to Perth. What a difference to the Emirates experience! Uncomfortable cramped plane, food was barely edible, no little niceties and generally just felt like a budget airline experience. To top it all off a week later we are still waiting for one of our cases to arrive in Perth! Qantas used to be a very good airline but the last 5 years it has slowly gone down and down in its standards. Very sad.","308":"Awful Qantas just keeps on cancelling flights and to hell with its customers. When will the law give us customers better rights against that sort of disgusting conduct.\nMy partner's flight to NZ was cancelled with no notice, at the airport. They said there would be a 4 hour delay. All of the passengers just sat around, missing whatever they had planned. Then after 6 hours qantas said, no, the next QF flight would be the next day. Only some people managed to get on an Air New Zealand flight on the same day, but much later..\nThen they just cancelled a flight we had to Perth. This time with 36 hours notice, and put on a much later flight rerouted around the country. That that messed up entirely the car hire and other arrangements we had put in place.\nWill never book to fly on Quarrelsome, Awful, Nasty, Terrible, Appalling, Shameless again.","309":"Lounge still needs attention, food selection in Qantas lounge is way below my experiences with others. The inflight experience was comfortable but definitely not worth the prices they are charging for their tickets. I think their flight attendants need to be refreshed, they look tired and worn out. In flight meals were good. Unfortunately due to late departure i missed my connecting flight and had to wait hours at Sydney for the next one.","310":"I am finding it impossible to use my 1.5M qantas points on flights. Tried on trip to USA, tried on trip to Vancouver and then recently tried on trip to Eygpt and despite tracking various routes, being happy to fly any class and being a platinum flyer over many years - nothing! Disappointing.","311":"At the start of your journey, you get greeted with the passive aggressive ladies at the check-in counter. Rude, arrogant and have massive chips on their shoulders. They need to learn some manners and basic customer service.\n\nI travelled 3-4 times a year on international flights with Qantas - only because of all the ff points through our business. Almost every time (unless I fly business class) the middle aged ladies are discriminating against all passengers of Asian heritages. If you take a look at reviews or public forums you will see how many times it\u2019s been stated by past passengers.\n\nIt\u2019s always the same middle aged Caucasian Australian female flight attendants who are exactly the same. They get extremely frustrated if you speak or ask them for something. They might as well had asked me to get my own water and food. They always make me feel like I\u2019m wasting their time and not worthy of their presence. Their attitude is so bad that sometimes I forget it\u2019s 2023 and racism still exists.\n\nThey are by far the worst airline in the world!","312":"- We flew on airbus a380 in 27th december. Qantas lost both our baggage for a week. I had ordered a special requirement meal and I was told at the plane that they forgot it to london. Cabin crew seemed not friendly and didn't ask us what we want to drink during dinner. In-flight entertainment was ok, but the touch screen was hard to use. It was really cold during the flight.\n+ The plane did depart on time","313":"Us four brothers, we have flown to queenstown for a GOLF tour and Quantas have lost ALL our golf clubs\/shoes\/ everything!!!!!\nwe planned this trip for months, it cost us an arm and a leg!!! and now we are spending our ducking days calling them, getting zero assistance!!!! zero info!!!!!!\nthey can\u2019t find the bags!!! they won\u2019t talk to us!!!!! all we get is a crappy phone message saying it\u2019s not there fault, it\u2019s all over the world issues\u2026..\ni\u2019m ducking fuming!!!! i will have my revenge!! i will get a lawyer and sue this ducking company for ALL our flights and golf tour!!!\nwho makes this many issues and simply says it\u2019s not our fault!!!!!! Duck them!!!!!!","314":"Worst service ever received from any airline. Booked it first time and had such a bad experience. Never recommend any one of this airline . From now on will be using my usual one","315":"I underwent major knee surgery in Brisbane and specifically purchased a window seat with extra leg room for my return flight to Canberra. (I was in a straight leg knee brace and on double crutches.)\n\nThe seat I bought was a window seat (15A) but during the actual flight, I was seated at 3C (aisle seat). I informed the steward that I bought a window seat with extra leg room (due to the fact that I had anticipated that I will be in a straight leg knee brace and possibly in pain). He told me that there is not much he can do to change my seat.\n\nTo my further horror, after I was seated, a man arrived for seat 3A (window seat). So, I had to get up off my seat to let him through. This ordeal happened three more times during the flight as he went to the bathroom. Each of these movements increased by pain and by the end of the flight, I was very nauseated from the pain. I finally threw up outside the Canberra airport.\n\nSince then, I have lodged numerous online claims with Qantas to have the extra leg room seat fare refunded. I have also rang them up to follow up on my online lodgements. These calls were constantly (and conveniently) dropped and when the staff have promised to ring me back, they never did.\n\nSo today (06 Jan 2023), I rang up again and Qantas has conveniently lost all my details (as such a long time has lapsed since the flight). This delay is caused by Qantas itself, as I have continually followed up on it.\n\nTo sum up, I paid for an extra leg room seat, didn't get it and was not refunded for it. This is deceit and fraud and I don't know where else this practice is acceptable.","316":"We are long term Qantas Frequent Flyers and have been loyal to this airline for over 2 decades. Recently our loyalty has been tested with a couple of poor travel experiences with Qantas in late 2022, culminating with this latest trip. This includes a very poor experience with Qantas Travel Money.\n\nOur recent travel experience occurred on 19.12.22 when we went to check in at Melbourne Airport as a family of 4 for our trip to Fiji via Sydney. On this occasion the staff member checking our in luggage omitted to place a baggage label on 1 of our suitcases and sent the suitcase down to the baggage handlers without any baggage label. We we travelling via Sydney and needed our luggage transferred to Fiji Airlines and therefore baggage labels were important.\n\nThis event occurred whilst I was dealing with the administrative matters for the family, being 4 passports, vaccination certificates, travel Insurance, and so forth, whilst the suitcases were being weighed and then sent down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. My husband politely pointed out to the staff member that they had just sent 1 of our suitcases down to the baggage handlers without any Qantas baggage label. Our daughters aged 20 and 18 had also noticed that the suitcase had disappeared down the 'chute' with no label.\n\nThere was then dispute when the staff member denied that the suitcase had been sent without any baggage label.\n\nWe hope that as a family that we were very polite to this staff member, however my husband and daughters were vey clear about the situation. Eventually the staff member acknowledged that they had sent 1 of our daughter's suitcase down the 'chute' to the baggage handlers. This suitcase had all of our daughter's clothes in it for her holiday and also our family's gifts to be exchanged on Christmas Day.\n\nIf any readers of this review have watched the 2022 media reports in relation to how baggage handles with Qantas have treated baggage at Melbourne Airpor recently, and also Charlie Pickering's parody of baggage handlers on \"The Yearly\" on Channel 2's IVEW, you will understand that we did not expect to see this suitcase again prior to the conclusion of our holiday.\n\nOur travel to and from Fiji, via Sydney on Qantas was very pleasant. My husband and I travelled business and our daughters travelled economy. It was our first trip as a family holiday since March 2020, when the pandemic commenced.\n\nHowever during whole flight from Melbourne to Nadi I worried that our daughter's suitcase would not appear in Nandi, and would be left at Melbourne Airport for weeks. This would have had a detrimental impact on our daughter's enjoyment of our her long awaited holiday.\n\nThe luggage did turn up in Nandi. However for our bookings in 2023 and 2024 we are now looking at other airlines. It is our cumulative experience with Qantas in the latter part of 2022, that sadly Qantas is not offering the service that we once so enjoyed from Qantas.\n\nMrs K","317":"Qantas supervisor in Queenstown Airport is the worst customer service representative I have seen. As a oneworld sapphire member, I was entitled to extra baggage but was denied. The supervisor did not know what oneworld is, and when i asked her to confirm, she yelled at me, \"I have worked for 4+ years. Do not teach me how to do things. I just follow the system, even if the system is wrong, it is Qantas' issue not my issue\". She asked me to file a complaint. I asked her what her name was. She said she could not tell me. I said the purpose she was wearing a name tag was because she needed to be accountable for what she did. She then ignored me and said, \"there is a queue sir, can you just finish what you are saying\". This is absolutely rude and arrogant!","318":"We were 4 adults and 2 children - coming out from the U.K. via Singapore to Sydney was good,great crew and comfortable cabin. However, a 14 hour delay en route home was NOT dealt with properly and promised compensation outstanding STILL. Yes, things go wrong, but it's how the issues are dealt with which demonstrates a company's integrity, and,unfortunately Qantas \"Customer care\" is non existent!!! So, a \u26a0\ufe0f warning. There also was an attempt to scam us when my husband messaged Qantas Customer care via Facebook \ud83d\ude11! So a double warning!","319":"My wife and I had our booking for a direct flight from Perth to London cancelled for \u201coperational reasons\u201d the day before departure and we were transferred to Emirates with a stopover in Dubai and no seat allocations. We had booked six months earlier and had paid a premium to travel direct. Qantas customer services were completely unhelpful. When asked if the flight had been cancelled, they said yes but according to flight radar it flew on schedule. Qantas deny any liability for compensation. Can only conclude that the flight was overbooked and we were bumped off it to solve the problem.","320":"Our flight to Brisbane left about 30 minutes late but most of the time was made up during the flight.\n\nReason for the delay was the air traffic at Melbourne Airport.\n\nI asked at the airport and was granted at no cost a window exit row seat.\n\nFlight was quite full.\n\nSnack was a simple over sized cookie.\n\nOverall a comfortable flight.","321":"I could not recommend this airline to my worst enemy. First of all, the turbulence was absolutely horrendous, I\u2019ve been to Japan a number of times, and never have I experimented turbulence been that bad and lasted up to an hour. While you can\u2019t blame the airline or the captain for it, but the way the staff handled their passengers was so disorganised. To note I have not been sick since I was a child, let alone motion sick; but this flight along with its disgusting food made me vomit. The flight attendants sure take their time to get to you even when the entire plane is quiet and seatbelt signs are off. After all the money you pay, you\u2019d expect great service.\n\nNot only is the actual flight experience bad, the moments leading up were worse. We booked a flight a flight in 2019, and because of Covid-19 it got cancelled. But not only was it cancelled, we did not receive a refund of the flight. We were told that the original flight money was kept as credit, and when we were given an opportunity to use the credit, prices for the exact flight doubled.\n\nWe will never fly with this airline ever again. Sticking with Singapore airlines, they know how to treat customers well.","322":"Flew QF1 from Singapore to London, and despite all the bad press Qantas has been receiving the flight was excellent from start to finish. We started in Perth, bags checked all the way to Paris, and the arrived on time when we did, tagged priority. Seats were 14E\/14F, for those not familiar, these are middle seats in the smaller front cabin of business class upstairs on the A380. Very comfortable seats, with nice bedding for sleeping (mattress pillow and blanket), and while the sash style seat belt was a little high for my wife I like the fact you can be slightly reclined for take off and landing with this seat belt. Food was good, plentiful and well presented, the all English crew was a little more reserved than the usual Australia based crew, but were very pleasant none the less.","323":"Qantas badged American Airlines flight, terrible food and not enough. Tell Qantas, they say I need to contact American Airlines. If you are going to put a Qantas badge on it make sure they a serving edible food and snacks\nNever will I fly with Qantas again","324":"First of all customer care service is terrible. No text messages and no emails send by the airline as if we are living in the stone age and they have no money to spend in their IT infrastructure. Secondly the flights are delaying every day and they even don't bother about messing the passengers. The seats are not at comfortable.","325":"Phone was playing up prior to departure but had received a code. On arrival at the check in area we needed baggage tags and boarding passes. Not a sign of any staff apart from one. Tried the auto machines but phone would not scan as requested. Went to speak to the one woman who immediately snapped \"Stand away from me\" She was apparently paranoid about covid but wasn't wearing a mask. I thought of suggesting that she get one. We were not the only people needing some polite assistance to get our tags as there was plenty of people trying to see her. The flight was fine with polite staff and as ex aircrew with thousands of flight hours I recognize and applaud those people for the job they do. However if this is what Qantas provide as passenger ground assistance we need to find another airline as this one has moved to the bottom of my list.","326":"All our 6 pieces of baggage have been lost. More phone calls, emails and messages sent by me and my travel agent than I can count and absolutely no interest from Qantas. If you value your possessions, choose another airline!! My daughter's chronic medication is in one of those suitcases, her health is at risk. We've had to buy new clothes, new toiletries and noone at Qantas cares one iota. We cannot get a doctor's appointment until the new year. Not even a courtesy call from Qantas or Menzies. Not 1 suitcase made the trip. Menzies Baggage Handlers (Qantas's handlers) don't respond. Qantas does not respond. CHOOSE ANOTHER AIRLINE!!","327":"Pros: Direct to Bangalore, very convenient departure and arrival times both ways.\n\nCons: Dated planes with barely any leg room in the economy,\n\nfood was horrendous and both ways there was no choice other than a potato curry with rice.\n\nOur flight was delayed by 90 mins in Bengaluru on the return leg after boarding, so the return leg became a 14 hr flight and we still got served 2 rabbit box takeaway potato curry.\n\nQantas for reasons only they know put me in the middle seat splitting a family of 4. I had 2 young kids and their mother on the left side and the father sitting on the right side of me. I asked the mother or father to move, so they could all sit together but both refused to sit with their own young children. Those 3 and 2 year old kids went absolutely nuts, high on pack of lollies. One of the kids emptied Orange juice all over me and their father sees it and says, \"they are just kids, that's OK\".\n\nin-flight entertainment system is non-existent, so download Netflix movies.\n\nTo make things worse, Qantas lost my baggage on return leg. It was delivered the next day with heavy sticky tape as Sydney Customs cut open my brand new bag to look inside even though it had a TSA approved lock. Apparently Aussie's are not required to use TSA keys.","328":"Economy passengers walking thru biz and using the biz class toilet.\n\nNo offer of pre meal drinks, even though the flight was clearly long enough to allow this to happen. This used to be routine many years ago, but is no longer standard practice.\n\nApart from these faults, the flight and lunch meal served were good.","329":"Meals on Qantas absolutely embarrassing. Paid $1700 for flights from Brisbane to Christchurch for my 4 yo granddaughter and I had requested child meal, was given a chicken in a Spice sauce and sloppy potatoes, I told them I had requested child meal and they said that is what the caterer supplied. Adults meal was even worse.\n\nYOU SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF, UP YOUR GAME QANTAS, I WILL ONLY BE TRAVELLING WITH AIR NZ FROM NOW !!","330":"Extremely disappointed with Qantas. Food was poorly presented and just passable in quality. Only one meal trolley,hence if you are at the back of the plane. Waiting was at least 2 hrs. Appalling entertainment system. Ear phones didn't work. No music no games, no camera on plane and movies low standard. Delay of 3 hrs departing with very poor communication. This flight cost me over $4000. What a rip off","331":"At approimately 3 hours before arrival at London on the non stop flight, we were told that our hold luggage had been off loaded before departure. However, we were promised it would be delivered to an address the next day. This did not happen and the 3 suitcases are still missing. We reported the issue to GBS and filled a report. We have tried to phone a variety of numbers but all the calls are unanswered.\nOverall, I would not even recommend this airline to my worst enemy.","332":"If i could give -0 to Qantas Flight. Not recommended at all. Poor customer service through their call centre. I booked and paid for a seat. At the time without letting me know they changed my mum's seat. did a complaint for seat refund. complaint was accepted still i did not received refund of seat booking. i called their call centre team. Sometime agent said thy had forwarded my complaint to the further department. When they dont have any answer for my queries than their team disconnect the call. Very rude behavious. Food is pathetic . My mom booked assistance from delhi airport. At the time they asked to 1500 INR for wheelchair assistance. Ridiculous at all.","333":"Flight been delayed by nearly 6 hours and counting. No announcements, just text messages that force you to look up via manage booking. No apology of any sort. Highest levels of arrogance, a national disgrace.\n\nI have been at Melbourne airport nearly 10 hours now, the only flights delayed are Qantas and Jetstar. No surprises here.","334":"My baggage was damaged and customer support is pathetic. They are neither replacing for new baggage nor compensating for the damages. They answer our calls but put our calls on hold or they either decline our calls. Worst service. Service is very bad and incharge head in Bangalore,Rajesh doesn't bother to either to answer our questions nor to our calls. Would suggest not to travel in Qantas airlines as their customers service is really worst. Hope no customers should face like this ever.","335":"I am currently wearing qantas PJs for the second day as apparently they are to incompetent to get my bag to me. Merry Christmas.\nBullet points.\nMissing two bags when I arrived\nGiven PJ's and a toothbrush etc kit (pretty useless. PJs - it is really hot here, wash kit, already have two as I had just spent 26 hours on airplanes!) Nothing for my 2 year old and no timeline given\nNumber given for contact never picked up (tried at least 10 times and left messages)\nOne bag finally turns up. Locks cut even though I gave them the code. Why do I even need to jlgive them the code? They locks are part of the bag\n\nDo yourself a favour. Just don't do it. We are now having Christmas day (2 days after landing) with only the Qantas PJs.","336":"I bought a Qantas ticket via Trip.com (avoid it, too) with my name spelled wrong. We spotted this error at the counter before check-in, and Qantas didn't want to help me with another ticket, so I lost my flight. The lack of humanity of these people is inexplicable. Qantas, If a customer has a problem with YOUR products, attend to the issue if the customer is right in front of you. I didn't deserve you playing the lousy lawyer game with me. On top of that, an error in YOUR system made me lose a premium seat, and I couldn't get my money back. The food is disgusting. There are no offices at the Brisbane airport and no humans around to even pretend they care about my problems. Without exaggerating, I had to wait 7 hours for someone to reply to the phone. These people are monsters with no soul, and you should avoid them.","337":"I have flown Qantas exactly twice before in 16 years of living in Australia. Both were domestic flights. The planes were old and service overall bearable. Virgin and Singapore Airlines have been my go to.\n\nRecently Qantas introduced a long haul flight from Sydney to Bangalore non stop. It was attractive and decided to fly the route with my family.\n\nI regretted the moment I stepped in the plane.\n\nIn no particular order\n\n1. The toilets werent cleaned and was smelling of piss. No hint of any air freshener, no seat liners.\n\n2. The meal trays weren't cleaned and there were significant sticky food stains from the previous flights\n\n3. The seat pouch was full of dust and and residue from earlier flights .\n\n4. Meal options were unavailable 1\/3 of the way in to economy class. Only two options chicken curry and cauliflower curry. Chicken ran out 1\/3 of the seats in. So had cauliflower curry. Horrendous mash of god knows what vegetable.\n\n5. Second meal was chicken parm and cauliflower with rice. Two meals on the same flight with same ingredients. I tried the chicken parm, with sweet potato mash and tomato. Couldn't eat it as it was to soggy.\n\n6. my screens and my daughters screen did not respond to touch unless u pushed through wirh all your might. I suspect the screen calibration was off.\n\n7. The inflight meal announcement was made in one of the most funniest Indian accents I have heard. I have never flown in a flight that was so bizzare. Should be introduced to accent neutralisation training.\n\nIn all this the crew did the best they could. I appreciate their service.\n\nThe experience is more than the crew. I suspect this is the result of cost cutting and the pure pursuit of profit. Qantas knows there is demand and not many options.\n\nThree of us paid approximately AUD 10k for return flights. We just reached Bangalore yesterday and now contemplating cancelling the return and booking the return leg on Singapore Airlines.\n\nI will ever fly Qantas again.","338":"It seems that every time I have flown Qantas recently, they find a way to mess up the schedule, such that it is impossible to plan. We were booked on a 7:30 am flight from Sydney to Melbourne and as it was early, expected plane and crew would be available and departure might be on time. All were on board and fifteen minutes later we were still at the gate and were advised there was a mechanical issue that would take at least 90 minutes to fix, so we off-loaded and were allocated a new flight one hour and one and a half hour later (all done reasonably well). Mechanical issues happen but the plane had obviously flown earlier, or the prior day and you would have thought a mechanical issue would have been corrected overnight. Erratic schedule changes and cancellations and now mechanical issues adds a new level of uncertainty when flying Qantas.","339":"We flew from Brisbane to Perth for a Christmas holiday - on flight 939 Dec 21st.\nThe flight itself was fine, but ... there were issues....\nThe food was nearing inedible -- not an expectation for the price paid for business class. You could have chipped a tooth on the pasta- dried out, little sauce, little flavor. (We should have had the \"economy class\" bangers and mash!). We have flown on many business class flight on other airlines - and Qantas food sits on the BOTTOM of the list ... come-on Qantas - get your act together !!\nThe level of cleanliness left much to be desired ... chunky dirt on the screen, and pen scribbles on the chair.\nThe choice of movies and programs was limited to \"B\" class fair.\nThe only saving grace was the service provided by the in-flight crew - especially the head steward - Irishman Patrick Ryan. He was excellent in every way! Great job Paddy!","340":"I honestly don\u2019t know where to start to describe how bad the experience was. The aircraft was in a desperate need of a refurbishment, one of my arm rests was broken and loose. The in flight entertainment is very old and functioning on and off - mostly off. The food is very basic and parts of the meal will be finished by the time the service reaches you and the staff will simply say \u201cwe run out\u201d and you just have to accept that. There is no WIFI - really not acceptable in this day and age. The plane was dirty with food scrums all over and the toilets were smelling of urine so bad I felt sick at some point.\nCustomer service is appalling throughout. The staff on board behave like they tolerate you at most. One of the flight attendants from Sydney to Singapore literally touched my face with her bottom twice during service and didn\u2019t even acknowledge it. They come with a bag to collect trash and if you are seated on the aisle seat expect to have the trash bag on your face when window and middle seat passengers are putting the trash in. I ended up picking their trays myself so I can avoid the trash bag touching my face. I have applied for an upgrade and it was rejected - I didn\u2019t see that as an issue initially although I have offered very close to the maximum amount. I asked again the ground staff at Sydney about the possibility of upgrading\/changing the seat but I was cut off immediately with an \u201cabsolutely not, the flight is full\u201d. It was not full - there were many seats available in many areas of the plane and 2 people sitting close to me were upgraded to first class for free in Singapore. No transparency whatsoever (makes you wonder what is really the criteria for upgrades?!) and no attempt to offer basic customer service - I wasn\u2019t expected anything for free.\nGenuinely the worst experience ever.","341":"Flew Qantas for my holiday in November was meant to fly Brisbane to Sydney then Sydney to Bangkok flight was delayed to Sydney then arrived at Sydney to not even be told our flight was changed and then forced to fly to Singapore and then Bangkok arrived in Sydney for no one to help then to find out our tickets weren\u2019t rebooked properly and then the same thing happened in Singapore tickets were rebooked properly all this was on Qantas arrived in Bangkok middle of the night both suitcases were left in Sydney no compensation was given and apparently I needed to prove I had to buy toiletries and clothes which was ridiculous you lost my bags of course I needed to purchase items! Now this was just all the logistical nightmare of Qantas now to the in flight I was smashed in the head with the meal service trolley and wasn\u2019t apologised to the food was ridiculously sub par and the seating space is just so small, toilets smelt very strongly of urine Qantas has made me truely appreciate the Asian airlines and only ever want to book with them!","342":"Last Dec 4th during COVID, I was not permitted to enter Australia. I was in Fiji and had to pay out of pocket for an immediate return flight, Which meant I had a credit. I've been in Australia now for 9 months and have to suddenly return to the states to assist a family member with terminal cancer. So I contacted Quantas they gave me a code for the credit and explained that all I need to do when preparing to purchase a ticket was to give them the code and pay the difference. Well the time has come for me to use this ticket so I called gave the code and was told that since I purchased from an agent I had to contact them....now Quantas had took over the ticket from Kayak. I contacted Kayak after spending a day trying to speak with a live representative who told me that Quantas owns the ticket.....after 6 calls and being told by Quantas I'm out of luck financially I reached a Quantas rep who dug deeper and with all my bitching took it upon herself to issue a refund which they processed immediately. Short end Quantas will do all they can not to honor a credit so keep pushing keep calling and do so during the week not the weekend you will speak to whomever wherever and they will hang up on you!!!!! Good luck. I forgot, so sin e they took ownership of the ticket I was held at ransom to pay their rate not the discounted rate I purchased very dirty move.....so do not ontact the airline if you purchased on line or with an agent they will take the ticket and charge you more. I was told by a representative that it's my fault for buying a discounted ticket I replied I'm in hospitality and understand fully that your company uses discounted ti kits to fill your planes as we fill our hotel rooms horrible service.....","343":"I would like to thank Miss Ping part of the ground staff at Qantas - Sydney International Airport for her awesome customer service. She made the on boarding experience a delight n ease.","344":"travelled over on Qatar and would give them 8 out of 10.... but would struggle to give Qantas 3 out of 10\nThe departures of all 3 flights were delayed. The service I received on the sector Sydney to Singapore was appalling. In flight staff in my area appeared to regard passengers as a nuisance and gave little\/no customer service. I had a call button on for over 40 mins as my inflight entertainment wasn't functioning.... it was not answered so I attempted to gain the attention of a passing stewardess and she just put up her hand and ignored me!!! I reported the non functioning system but to no avail. It wasn't fixed whilst in Singapore so i had to travel the whole distance from Sydney to Singapore ( over 22 hours) without one.\nFood was served 'McDonald's style' !!! .... no starters or deserts and with wooden ( absolutely dreadful) or plastic ( not much better) utensils and plastic containers for drinks. I asked for a cup of tea as did the person next to me... neither of us received one(Singapore to Londonnsector).\nI should make it clear that Qatar presented meals 'old style' with proper meal trays.... starters and deserts...proper utensils and proper glasses.\nCharging points in my and the seat next to me were also not working.\nWhen I complained to Qantas they offered 2000 Frequent Flyer points as compensation ( worth next to nothing and a complete insult)\nI worked for Qantas many years ago and was proud to do so at that time.\nNow.... I would not choose to do so and would not recommend that anyone else do so either !!","345":"Whilst Qantas CEOs bucket the millions, customer service has completely gone down the drain.\n\nAll I want to do is change a domestic flight in Australia (because the system won\u2019t let me do it online) and I\u2019ve been waiting over an hour to get through! This is not the first time this has happened in the past month!","346":"I booked through Expedia and due to a technical fault on the system had to make a minor amendment to a passenger name. I was then advised that Qantas refuse to make any amendment whatsoever resulting in me having to cancel all the flights and rebook. This cost me \u00a3600. The customer service was dreadful from Qantas. Their staff are very incompetent and can't wait to get you off the phone. Please avoid this company at all costs. You will regret it and lose money.","347":"Second time we've done the non stop\/before we flew 1 stop \/little jet lag \/EXPENSIVE but the only way to travel","348":"There is no joy in bashing Qantas, once a great airline and I doubt anyone at senior manager level in Qantas cares or reads reviews but they should as they might learn how bad the service is and in time they will see the outcome; most businesses who ignore customers fail in time. Despite emails from Alan Joyce claiming the love their customers and the extra points and other platitudes the service has not changed, a classic example of a flight from Melbourne to Sydney. It was scheduled for 7:30 pm and at 5:00 pm on the way to the airport in peak traffic the text came through the flight had been cancelled and we were booked on an earlier flight at 6:30 pm. Great news if we could get there on time, which we did. However the flight departed at 7:10 pm, because the crew arrived at 6:30 around he time of departure with no advice the flight was delayed. Qantas must know a day in advance that they need to cancel flights, or lower prices (now very high) to encourage more users but they leave it and hour and a half before they advice customers of he new flight plans. Imagine the complexity of getting people on different flights, arranging aircraft and crew and dispensing with those that expected to be flying; sounds to me like a giant mess and cost issue. You now cannot plan with Qantas who are totally unreliable but sadly my squillion points keep me with an unreliable and dysfunctional airline. The Business Class lounge is now awful and the bags took 30 minutes to arrive and the one tagged Premium Service arrived last--looks like an Irish picnic to me and someone forgot the purpose.","349":"Qantas carried us on the last leg of our flight from London to Auckland.they managed to lose our checked in bag,Childs pram and car seat from Sydney to auckland.almost impossible to speak to anyone from Qantas ;,they do not respond to emails and their online lost baggage app is a fake.had to buy a car seat to get ourbaby back from the airport.our pram arrived 7 days into the holiday ,our car seat on day 10 and are still waiting for our checked in bag on day 12 .disgusting treatment of customers.We will never fly Qantas again","350":"Don't book with Qantas ! We recently bought a return flight via their website (NOT a third party) with a connection from Sydney to Europe. This was the most expensive flight for our journey, but had the best connection each way. In the end, Qantas changed both our first flights, resulting in missing the connections on the way in and out. We ended up with a 24 hours connection on the way in and a 12 hour connection on the way out. What would have been a very long flight turned into a 3 days nightmare. Needless to say, Qantas did not offer a proper solution or any compensation at all. They just washed their hands and we've been treated as hostages, not customers. AVOID !","351":"Flight out on 6th october in economy, no complaints at all, couldnt have been better looked after by 1st class crews. Returned on 18th november with my husband needing help after suffering walking difficulties while on our visit to family. Qantas staff couldnt have been more helpful. We were in premium on our return flight,which helped, but they were absolutely marvellous, arraged help for us and another really good flight with friendly careing crews. Thank you qantas.","352":"Another great Qantas \"experience\" I have 6 lounge passes due to being in the points club and Amex Qantas. Could not get into lounge even with print out of passes. \"You have to log on to web site\" (was in the app). Please move aside (voice dripping in condescension) use the cheat sheet (of course that does not match their web site - does not work) return to counter \"it's not our job to help you\". Well Sarah (Sydney, Q Club) well done, confirmed that once I have used my points I will do everything to avoid flying with Qantas. (She was unaware that my wife is silver, I was pushing gold before I retired). #QANTASSUCKS had the nerve to gaslight me on top when I was being perfectly civil given the circumstances.","353":"Worst ever customer service. It\u2019s been a nightmare to dealt with to process a refund.\n\nIts now 3 months since I cancelled my flight, rang the airline more than 12 times each time waiting on the line for more than 40 minutes !and each time get a same answer from the consultant that the \u201crefund team has advised you will receive the refund in 6-7 weeks!\n\nAfter 2 months the answer changed to \u201c refund team has advised in 3-5 days refund will be back into your account \u201c\nthen on the third month time changed to \u201c refund team has advised in 48hr refund will be back into your account!\nAnd here we go! Now after 2 weeks from the last response response, I just have been told that will take 6-8 weeks for my refund to be processed!!!!\n\nThis the Answer that I got on day 1!!!!\n\nI have filed a complaint while ago and had no response since!\n\nHave received no response, no email, I would give 0 rating if I could.\n\nWorst ever airline, will never buy again!","354":"The sign of a good airline is how they handle disruptions. Unfortunately, on the 30th November Qantas had a disruption with their QF10 flight from London, and their shabby lack of communications, illustrated to me that in their pursuit of profitability they have forgotten their duty of care towards their passengers.\n\nOn the evening of the 29th November, I accessed my booking to ascertain the LHR departure terminal in order that I could book a taxi to the airport. To my surprise, there was a notice advising a 11 hr delay on this flight. Next morning, my booking again showed an 11 hr delay leaving LHR but surprisingly, it was showing the flight arriving on time into MEL with a 12h 05 total flight time! Although, during the day I received several emails from Qantas marketing asking me to purchase their merchandise, there was never any email nor SMS advice received from Qantas regarding this extended delay.\n\nThis situation continued until 1800 on the day of our departure, when I received a push notice from Qantas to say they had move my wife and I to the Emirates flight out of London. They also gave us our seat assignment, but when we checked in at LHR, Emirates told us these seats numbers didn't exist on their aircraft. As a result, we were unable to sit together all the way back to MEL.\n\nI believe Qantas should have advised us and the other passengers of the flight delay, rather than leaving us to discover this for ourselves. Apart from the message advising us of the change to Emirates, there was no communications re this flight, received from Qantas.\n\nAll in all, after this experience I would rate Qantas as a third world airline with customer service standards similar to Ryanair in the UK.","355":"We flew Business class from Melbourne to Christchurch and the service was appalling.\nTo top it off they asked what we'd like to eat, either a beef curry or pork dish. We both said beef curry and when they came to serve it to us they said there's only one beef curry left as the pilot doesn't eat pork and they gave him the other one. WTF?????. Why even tell us that, just say there's only one beef curry left.\nOther service issues as well but can't be bothered mentioning them, just don't fly qantas.","356":"After repeatedly following up Qantas for the guaranteed (yes, in writing) refund, we are still waiting to get our money back, now 9 months on.\nShame on you Qantas. You are a disgraceful organisation. Give us OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!","357":"Staff were rude to the majority of customers. They ran out food options. Service was appalling, I witnessed staff rudely asking \u201cwhat do you want\u201d instead of what would you like to eat. Trip was delayed and bags were delayed by 16 hours.\n\nI would pay extra not to fly with Qantas. Terrible fall from grace","358":"On QF 104 from Honolulu QANTAS run out of food twice. Only the vegetarian option was available which was very average. Staff did not care and were rude.\n\nDon't pay top dollar with this mob if you can fly with a different airline.","359":"I\u2019m writing on behalf of my daughter, son in law ,and two grandchildren. They booked a flight and chose their seats twelve months in advance of flying to the UK for a family Christmas. Less than 24 hours before they were due to fly . They received an email to say the flight was cancelled due to operational circumstances. Lie number 1 . We are on flight radar and the flight was not cancelled. Qantas decided to \u201c bump off\u201d a family with two children!!! The initial flight was , Melbourne to Perth , Perth to Heathrow. Instead they were put on flights Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Singapore ( around midnight with two tired children) to Heathrow. The first leg of the flight they were split up . It wasn\u2019t until they landed in Sydney did they manage to get seats together for the duration of the flights. Also on the first leg , no meals for the children. These hadn\u2019t been noted for the entire flights until my daughter realised and sorted that out.\nOur son in law is a neurologist consultant at the RCH and is a frequent flyer with Qantas travelling the world with his research.\nMy husband managed to speak with a supervisor who was sympathetic but couldn\u2019t offer any means of compensation and suggested filling in a form as it is impossible to speak to anyone in customer service.\nThis has caused undue stress and is despicable treatment.","360":"After taking four international qantas flights, I noticed my airpoints hadn't been added. My qantas number was on my booking, I raised it with Qantas and provided all the relative booking info, boarding passes even a copy of my passport and the have still said it's not enough proof even though my qantas number is on the booking. I keep getting generic answers. I'm asking for my points, not gold bars from the bank!","361":"all of the flight attendants were very rude! from before we got on the plane until we got off this way too long flight. I found it hilarious that the boarding announcements asked that the passengers please be kind to your flight attendant!?! That made me laugh! You get what you give people! I thought it was funny because we got far better service on Jetstar. This was my 2nd flight with this carrier, I always thought of them as a really good airlines but after this last fiasco nope never again unless its a free flight.","362":"Plane was old and full to the maximum with 2 lavatory facilities for about 200 people, left sitting on a tarmac for 40 mins whilst previous flight's luggage was offloaded and ours loaded up. Was charged for 2 extra kgs and the luggage did not even make it on same plane and Qantas refused to refund or offer any discount. Definitely not worth almost $1,000 for a one way flight with this terrible service!! Qantas should be ashamed of their name. Consumer watchdog needs to step in and start regulating bit better, especially now that people are flying more and airlines are getting away with whatever they like!","363":"The cabin crew was very rude during their service. Very arrogant ,unfriendly and not helpful. One particular stewardess who looked like a supervisor was extremely rude when i asked her for a coffee.\n\nThe trip into Chrtistchurch from Brisbane was really good. Very polite crew.\n\nThis was my experience.","364":"We cancelled this flight a few weeks before it flew, and we're promised a full refund by Qantas (approx. $1260). However, it would take 8-12 weeks to process (incredible given it took 8-12 seconds to take the money from our account).\n\nThe 12 weeks passed. No refund. We called in week 13 (each call takes 45 mins plus) and we're told it was imminent, but they were experiencing delays. Nothing came.\n\nWe called again at the start of Week 15. They said 'it's been processed right now'. You will receive an email confirming this shortly. We got the email confirming the full refund had been processed and would be in our account in 3-5 working days.\n\nAfter the 5 working days passed, we have no refund. We called Qantas again. They said 'we've sent the money, it must be with you bank'. We called ANZ - they have never seen any evidence of a payment by Qantas. They provided proof of this.\n\nWe called Qantas again, with the ANZ proof. They can't help us, as their records show the refund has been processed, so ANZ must be 'mistaken'.\n\nWe know now that after 20 weeks; we're never seeing the money again. Qantas has literally stolen $1,200 from us, as well as making us waste hours on pointless phone calls.\n\nQantas is obviously a dying airline, and we know in a few years or so we'll get the satisfaction of seeing their corrupt \/ inept staff being made redundant in their hundreds. That'll help; as will our plan to lodge so many complaints, calls and other communications at Qantas that will we ensure they spend far more than $1200 dealing with us in the long run. But if you haven't ever used them, take our advice and stay far away. We can all speed up the decline of this pathetic bunch of thieves by picking alternatives wherever possible.","365":"Made booking online, paid by B-pay. The connection flight dropped out - with multiple bookings.\nTalked to customer service and received inconsistent information (payment received, not received).\nReceipt provided to them, which I found a way myself, not provided by the customer service team.\nWas told the issue was resolved but then received cancellation emails.\nPromised callback never happened - at least 3 times already.\nPut on-hold to be transferred to the manager, after 10 phone calls, then got cut off\/hung up immediately. Waited 5 minutes for a callback, but did not get one.\nCalled back in 5 minutes after waiting, was told the manager was NOT IN THE BUILDING (so was that a planned hung up no service??)\nHorrifying customer service. negative stars if possible.\nWill remove\/modify the comment if satisfying resolution but I doubt it.","366":"Another as expected 1 star performance by QANTAS; the aircraft departed late, the in-flight entertainment system was non-existent, and the service was ordinary. The aircraft was not clean and to top it off, the flight bridge on arrival was not functional resulting in an extended 20-minute stay inside the aircraft on arrival.","367":"Mildly surprised that a 3 star allocation has been earned. The flight departed on time for a change, the service was quite ok, and the aircraft landed on time. The food is still assessed as abysmal with a sloppy wrap with a tasteless filling, whilst the entertainment system actually was functional for a change.","368":"Schedule change to an earlier departure which suited us fine and allowed arrival in Sydney at a more advantageous time for us. Benefited also by using discounted FF points to secure our seats. Impressed with ease of bag drop and efficient boarding. Fast delivery of luggage on arrival. Enjoyed our on-board snack but it just isn't what it used to be. Comfortable flight throughout and the in-flight entertainment adequate for the journey. Seated in 16B & C.","369":"We were very lucky, no flight delays or cancellations. Return mel to lax. Flight was ok, bit bumpy as its smaller planes that they are using and no wifi . My friend was in business class and she didnt have wifi either. Flight to LA staff were rude and grumpy, return flight they were nice. Seemed to be very hit and miss when it came to service and food. Considering the price of flights at the moment, I expect better from Qantas .","370":"Qantas cancelled our direct flight from LA to Sydney a day before the flight and gave us a flight that goes from LA to Melbourne using United Airlines then from Melbourne we will catch a qantas plane to Sydney. They have allowed 1 hour for us to get off the plane go through customs and grab our bags then go to the domestic terminal to check in and catch our flight. I feel that qantas was not very efficient in handling this issue and it feels like they said we don\u2019t care what happens to you as long as we\u2019ve provided you a way home. They were not helpful when we called up about our cancelled flight, the lady on the phone even had the audacity to start yelling at us on the phone, she did not assist us with trying to find a direct flight that will get us home. My partner and I paid for direct flights for a reason and direct flights are more expensive for a reason. We are very unhappy with qantas as our 14-15hour journey home has now become a 20+ hour journey. This is not the service we expect from such a reputable company. DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS unless you want the headache we\u2019ve had to deal with.","371":"I haven\u2019t even travelled yet but so wish I hadn\u2019t booked with Quantas. My original booking was a direct flight to Melbourne with a refuelling in Perth. This was then changed by Quantas to a flight to Perth with a separate flighr to Melbourne five hours later.\nI rang Quantas customer services this morning, waiting 40 minutes for my call to be answered. I wanted to make sure that I didn\u2019t have to pick up my bags at Perth and check in to the new flight, as I was presuming it was a connecting flight since I\u2019d booked a flight to Melbourne. At first the agent confirmed that my bags would be checked straight through but then he saw the length of the stopover and said I would probably have to pick up my bags and check in to the new flight. I told him that I was travelling alone and would like a definitive answer. He couldn\u2019t give me that and saud I should check with security staff at Perth. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy with that and asked to speak to his supervisor. I was put on hold and then got a voice message saying that the offices were closed and ai needed to call back. 40 minutes of my life wasted and no further forward n\nApart from how bad customer services is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that an airline can change a single flight to two flights to suit themselves. Not impressed.","372":"Flight got delayed from 11:45 in morning to 22:45. When checking in the morning of flight on way to airport, NO MENTION OF THIS DELAY. Staff at airport were nice and cordial and I think shocked at ineptitude of their airline. Even worse, transfer from Perth to Melbourne which was originally a short wait after LH to Perth, IS NOW AT 3 IN THE AFTERNOON OF THE NEXT DAY. 16 hour overnight wait. Never using this airline again.","373":"As there was no other SYD-ADL flight in the afternoon, I had to wait many hours in the business lounge. The menu was \u2018all day dining\u2019. Pumpkin and coconut soup was delicious. Unfortunately, as the flight was delayed, I ended up waiting for10 hours and finally on board to Adelaide, which was full. My seat was changed from 2D to 1D. Row 1 has more leg room, but you have to put everything in the upper locker. As I felt cold and began to sneeze, I put on my coat and asked for a face mask. I felt better by eating a hot quiche rather than cold salad.","374":"When I bought a ticket during the \u201cTogether Once More\u201d campaign in March, it was a HND-MEL flight. But only a couple of weeks before the trip, Melbourne flight was cancelled and I was put on the Sydney flight. So the business class on this Sydney flight was full. As I was feeling cold, I asked the customer service manager to raise the temperature. My seat was also 2K, which I found it better than 1K, as the little side table along the isle keeps the seat more private. As I am small, the width of the seat is OK for me to recline to sleep.\nI ordered a Japanese cuisine, hoping the main fish dish would be good. But the contents in the Bento box as well as the cooked bonito fish were disappointing. Nevertheless, the little sweets at the end was a real Japanese cake, which I enjoyed.\nPrior to arrival in Sydney, they served cafe breakfast. Before the Covid, I got sick and tired of the same cafe breakfast, but for this time I found it just enough and sufficient.","375":"It was a very long wait in the Qantas First Lounge, where they always treat the customers loyally with the freshly cooked food. I had a pan-fried barramundi with broccolini, crab meet (without pork) on some kind of noodles and green tea. Later, I asked for an ice cream sandwich, that was perfect. Then, I had a nap till boarding in the evening. I want to post this in the Qantas Sydney First Lounge page, but TripAdvisor won\u2019t let me. At least someone who reads this know how good the First lounge is.\nMy seat on SYD-HND was 2K, second on the right window seat. Width of the seat isn\u2019t as wide as the domestic business class seat. I ordered a Japanese cuisine. Zensai (Entr\u00e9e) in a bento box was really nice, but I didn\u2019t want to eat the main beef steak. The little desert was not a Japanese \u2018kashi\u2019 but a small piece of cheese cake, which was very disappointing\nI somehow slept a bit and noticed that the flight attendant began to serve breakfast for those who were already awake. I imagined a small piece of bread and fried eggs, but it was a sandwich of thick bread with tomato relish. So I could hardly eat it, feeling sorry for the people who were hungry in the war-torn countries.","376":"I had a relatively long wait in the Adelaide Qantas Lounge, as the 14:30 flight to Sydney was cancelled and I had to be on the 13:30 flight. There wasn\u2019t any more flight until evening. As I needed to eat lunch, but I don\u2019t eat beef. So a kind staff made a cheese and ham toasted sandwich and brought it to me with green salad. The lunch menu for ADL-SYD was either toasted sandwich or spicy beef noodle. As there was no other choice, not even a side salad dish, I had the toasted sandwich, but the bread was very thick! I complained to Qantas several times, they prefer to serve beef and seldom serve hot chicken dish in the business class.","377":"We have flown to Australia many times, mostly in riffraff class. Historically we have used Singapore Airlines and many years ago used Qantas, who were then excellent. We decided to change back to Qantas as the Singapore meal offerings were a little too Asian for us. The experience travelling with Qantas was poor, from miserable ground staff to an even more miserable flight crew. The main menu offering was \u2018Plant based food\u2019 ( presumably for the Eco warriors and veggies on board,) or Tofu and noodles (wtf) and beef casserole with Mash. Fortunately we were able to swerve the first two offerings and plump for the beef casserole thingy. Qantas are definitely cutting back on their food, no bread rolls, no cheese and biscuits etc. The food on internal flights we had with Qantas was poor as well,on board aging and tatty airplanes. We flew back home with Emirates, a totally different experience, 100% better than Qantas. Alan Joyce - stop milking the company of millions and try one of your long haul flights to understand why Qantas is going down the pan - and try to speak to anyone at your call centres. Qantas are now nearly as bad as British Airways!!","378":"Had to fly to Bali on a business trip, only there for 2 days. Flew Business class to ensure that I could get some sleep in the plane on the way back as I had to attend a conference on the morning of my return.\nTurned out the plane was an old 737-800 which is the same one they use on the run between Melbourne and Sydney. the seats barely reclined and this was nothing like a business class standard seating or space. I will NEVER fly business class again with Qantas without checking what plane is being used for the flight first.","379":"A Lack of respect, they wouldn't check cameras for me on a missing item which turned out to be stolen.\nRather they made me wait 4 days to do any further investigating. By that point was too late.","380":"Absolutely appalling service!! Lost all my luggage and no one ever answers the phone. Woman at Aukland was rude and not interested, gave me a phone number to ring that doesn't even work! Shocking is an understatement. Would never recommend this company to anyone.","381":"After booked tickets that got cancelled due to covid, a year later we were granted a refund. After 38 hours on the phone, 73 emails send, 86 promisses later, we are still waiting for the actual money to be paid\u2026","382":"Our original flight was LAX to Melbourne direct, this was changed to a connecting flight via Sydney to Melbourne. Qantas arranged the connecting flight, allowing two hours from landing at Sydney to transfer. Our flight landed ~15-20 mins late, we collected our luggage and cleared customs etc and got to the Qantas domestic transfer at 9.30am for a 10.30am flight. A good hour before it was due to fly.\n\nWe were immediately told we would be missing our flight and would be re-booked onto another one. Despite having an hour to spare! The bag-drop \/ check-in team at the transfer looked to be deliberately dragging their feet to collect luggage to ensure that no-one could get on their 10.30am syd-melb flight, which was about half the flight from our quick roll-call. Instead of delaying the syd-mel 10.30am flight by a 10mins to get us on board, they rebooked everyone onto later flights, the earliest we heard from our fellow economy comrades was 5pm. We're booked onto a 5.45pm flight to Melbourne, fingers crossed we get home by Christmas. If only Rex flew international.\n\nNo apology, no explanations, just 'it is what it is'.","383":"Lost luggage for 2 days (which is a very likely occurrence with Qantas these days) and when I wrote back to claim for expenses as suggested by luggage handling team, was awarded A$60 as compensation to be paid upon filling up a pdf claims form. Which was fine until you realise there is no way to send back the form as the email address provided bounces back all response emails. 3 separate and new customer feedback form submissions and two calls to the service hotline later, issue remains unsolved (in fact ignored).\n\nWhy bother to put up a semblance of customer service when Qantas is simply going to ignore customers anyway. Will avoid flying with them if I can help it even if it means taking worse airlines. At least I am not paying a premium airfare to be ignored.","384":"We recently had the unfortunate need to fly Qantas Perth to Vancouver via Sydney, then Dallas to Perth via Sydney\nDelayed on first flight and had to spend a night in Sydney, lost bags between Dallas and Sydney, then two hour delay Sydney to Perth\nDO NOT fly with Qantas, they have gone from world class to third world and everyone is sick of their excuses","385":"what a great flight, the cabin crew was excellent, could not do enough for you, great choice of meals also the meals were very good, snacks any time you wanted them, went to stretch our legs at the rear of the plane crew made us coffee and snack, had a good yatter with them very friendly, long flight but enjoyed it due to cabin crew, free headphones, ear plugs, eye masks, toothbrush and paste, Qantas keep it up","386":"I am an offshore worker up north and just had a few guys fly from Perth to Broome then offshore from another remote air strip, they were told their bags were not loaded in Perth due to overweight. Ridiculous. 55 people all up. No idea this decision was made until they got to Broome. Just would not expect this in Australia. The guys for my company still have no luggage, as you can imagine we have very little to give these guys offshore to help them. Not good enough. Qantas failure.","387":"Arrived at the airport to find out I had been bumped to the next flight, no prior warning (I will be late for work and could have slept in). Charged $50 for baggage, as i was 2kgs over the limit. Not a single human staff member around to ask about flight or baggage","388":"Boarding delayed 15 minutes\nHad to board using steps down from airbridge, across tarmac and up steps though the galley door at the back in order to cram an extremely full flight in the shortest time possible.\nMy knees touching seat in front.\nNo USB charge ports.\nIn flight entertainment consisted of tiny shared drop down screen every 3 to 4 seats with a pre chosen movie which you could not listen to because no headphones were made available.\n\nExcellent flying despite exceptional headwinds\nEfficient cabin staff.\nAcceptable meal in a box.\n\nSeverely degraded experience compared with previous Qantas flights.","389":"served spinach and ricotta sandwich they should have served nothing\/ Aussie cheese and jazz biscuit would have been better\/see why the eco is on such a high wage because they are now a very basic budget airline when they use to be no 1 in Australia price was extreme\/ delayed flight twice on way back \/ never again safety has probably gone out the door as well \/flew rex not one complaint now there is an airline who know what they are doing","390":"What service\nIt is the worst airline from airport service to the phone service to not being able to use a credit voucher to rebook a resident flight\nI would have given them a zero","391":"I wasn't going to write this review, but whilst in the business class lounge I just overheard (sorry!) a person next to me trying to change their flight. More money they were told.\nIf I was concerned that my switch to Virgin 10 years ago was a mistake then today's experience - as a lifetime Qantas Gold member - dispelled that thought.\nArriving in Auckland from Santiago on LATAM at 5 a.m. in the morning, I tried to jump on the earlier flight to Brisbane from Auckland (instead of waiting for 11 hours) and was told the Bus Class lounge staff can no longer make the changes. I need to contact reservations. Which I did. Then was told to contact my travel agent - at 2 a.m. in the morning Australia time!!\nQantas is no longer an airline friendly to its once stalwart frequent flyers. Long gone are the days of simple flight changes or - yes, I do remember these - free upgrades. Now you struggle to get a flight at a fair price and there's no way to make a change to your booking without a new fee.","392":"Arriving at the airport I was running on time but had not yet checked in. EverytimeI tried to check in it wanted me to download an App. So getting to the airport I tried to check in and there now no facilities to check in at the airport. I asked for assistance as I was running out of time and was basically told \" I am busy, please find some one else or download the App\". I was quite frustrated and attempted the App download. Proceeded with the setup of the App and then got stuck with a clunky App that confused me on how to check in for my flight. I again found some one to try and help me with my check in, and to be told \" there is only a few more minutes left before I check in closes, Sorry but there is nothing I can do for you\". My comment was, \"your are just walking away, your not going to help me?\". The response was, \"yes,\nRing the call centre\". I proceeded to ring the call centre and after 26 mins waiting I was answered by an employee who sounded like they had just woken up, the audio quality was so poor, muffled and full of static that I could barely hear the the helpdesk agent on the other end. To top it off I could hear, the TV show in the background and restless children. After a few minutes of struggling with the sound, the helpdesk just hung up. I had to then ring again and wait another 15 mins to try and get further help.\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ONE OF THE BEST AIRLINES IN THE WORLD.\nI am just a drop in the ocean, as they will see it, just one customer of thousands that has had a bad experience. What they don't realise that each drop creates a ripple and each ripple erodes the foundations of any structure over time.","393":"The first leg of my flight was delayed I got a text message saying delayed 30 minutes but there is still time to make my connecting flight. So I proceed to the airport. When I get there another message tells me the flight has a further delay and I have 25 mins to make the second flight on arrival at Melbourne. Then another saying my connecting flight is at risk.I talk to the service desk who tells me I have been rescheduled on a new flight tomorrow at 06:30 from melbourne to Newcastle Qantas has booked a Hotel for me. At the gate the Qantas staff then tell me the Newcastle flight will be held until we get there as there are several Newcastle bound traveler's on the flight from Adelaide. We we eventually get to Melbourne the flight to Newcastle has long since gone. I queue up at the service desk to be handed a new boarding pass with a hotel address scribbled on the back and a note saying I have a $50 food voucher. The flea pit of. Hotel they booked me in doesn\u2019t have a restaurant open in the evening They do have soft drinks on sale. The restaurant is only open in the morning for breakfast at 07:00 I have to be at the airport for 05:45. I rang Qantas customer care, on hold for almost an hour only to be fobbed off and told pay for food yourself and keep the receipts, Qantas Customer care will reimburse me. Customer care\u2026..what a joke.","394":"We have recently returned from a 6 week holiday in the USA. We elected to fly with Qantas for no other reason than they were the cheapest. Our original flight from Brisbane was due for a 10am departure but the whole flight was cancelled and we were relegated to the \u2018red eye\u2019 10.30pm departure that same night. We had booked overnight hotel accommodation at the airport due to the early departure of the original flight. This accommodation was non-refundable so we lost that when the flight was changed. The aircraft that Qantas is currently using is an A330, which we quickly found was totally unsuitable for a long haul flight. Less leg room, seats didn\u2019t seem as wide, and the aisle was that narrow that when someone walked down it they would bump the aisle passenger. Food was rubbish. Flight attendants sleeping quarters consisted of a curtained off part of the centre seating, amongst all the passengers. There was no are suitable to actually get up and stretch the legs. Overall, this was the worst long haul flight that I have experienced","395":"Used points for short trip to Auckland via Brisbane.\nWith only 90 minutes between landing in BNE and taking off from international terminal, and knowing of the delays in screening\/immigration, I spent 90 minutes and two phone calls (the first one dropped out after 35 minutes and no callback) trying to change to an earlier SYD-BNE flight (there were reward tickets available) only to be told \"75 minutes is enough time\". So arrived at lounge in Sydney and the staff were happy to change the flight for me.\n\nDomestic business class has simply deteriorated - no pre-flight drink and limited choice for breakfast. Flight from BNE to AKL was delayed due to radio issue (they even 'reset' the plane by powering down and then powering up again) followed by another tech issue (\"strange fuel usage indicator\") before 40 min delayed take off.\n\nTrans-Tasman business service has also taken a cost-cutting hit. No pre-flight hot towel, limited service options and limited drink choice. Crew did not follow up with any offers of 'top ups' of drinks, basically disappearing into the galley.\n\nIFE is also now worse than most budget airlines. Another cost-cutting measure. Plus no wi-fi in this day and age?\n\nWas looking at using alot pf points on future QF overseas holiday but will now use them on partner airlines. Qantas has gone downhill badly post COVID with cost-cutting all over - except for airline executive bonuses of course.","396":"My personal experience.\n1. Transfer flight was cancelled 1 hour before depart\n2. Only me & my wife dinner was not service on board.\n3. Book 2 separate flight (3 pax) for the cancelled transfer flight.\n4. Luggage lost during transfer flight.\n5. Promised lost luggage will arrive later that next night (but another empty promise)\n6. Was told there was a 24 hour hotline for lost luggage but it was non operative at night.\n7. Cannot confirm when my luggage will arrive when we wasted our time & holiday itinerary to drive down to the airport and check.\n\nLong\/short\nBudget airline is much better.","397":"I\u2019d like to say the customer service with this airline is absolutely disgusting. Over the past years I\u2019ve noticed the staff and especially cabin crew being more entitled as they come. I was with my grandma who has an accent . As I was in the bathroom a flight attendant asked her if she wanted any beverages and as she said what she wanted she proceeded to tell her to speak \u201cnormally\u201d and the overall customer service was disgusting. So rude and entitled I have travelled with multiple airlines such as Garuda and Singapore airlines all with amazing service. I\u2019d say quantas is some of the worst airlines I\u2019ve been to when it comes to the well-being and the service of the passengers","398":"I called Qantas customer service to ask about being seated next to my partner and Ralph was so kind and understanding to me being a nervous flyer!\nSo happy with my service","399":"We had to sit in broken business class seats on our 14- hour flight. The seats did not recline and we had to sit upright the entire flight. A couple next to us at the ticket counter were told that their business class seats were also broken on the same flight.\nQantas Airlines needs to attend to the maintenance of their planes.","400":"Aircraft A330\nThere were no pre lunch drinks served, a first world problem some would say, however, I was most certainly paying first world prices. Onward, the first and only words uttered to me after the seat belt sign had been extinguished was, I quote \" butter chicken or Massaman beef \" I can only presume hello \/how are you\/we have a choice of... have also been dropped from Qantas flights due to Covid. My wife on the other hand was asked \u201chow about Massaman Beef\u201d that in itself tells its own story. The drinks service was positively accommodating in comparison, in as much as I was asked \u201cwould you like red or white\u201d and that ladies and gentlemen was the sum total of Qantas hospitality on a 4 hour flight. This is simply not an acceptable business class product, never again.","401":"13\/11\/22 Flight Delayed till 8pm then delayed to the next day (14\/11\/22) 12 noon no reason given. This delay meant I could not attend two important appointments on Monday. The only compensation given was for the first delay was a $25 food voucher to use at the very limited places at he airport - all takeaway food. The compensation for the overnight delay was they paid for the nights accommodation and $50 food voucher. The service on board was mediocre and the food would be better not to offer food. Came in cardboard box and tasted disgusting. The choice of drinks was extremely limited. Next time I will try Air NZ","402":"Qantas - you were once the pride of Australia, so sad that you have fallen off that pedestal....\nMy mum and I travelled Return to Bali with you.....to start off - I haven't grown any taller but your leg room has certainly become shorter; never have mum and I been so cramped on an International flight and we have both flown around the world with many airlines......\nNext I called the hostess to ask if there was something wrong with my chair because it didn't recline - to my utter surprise she said \"they are faulty and broken\"; how then could Qantas place a passenger in a broken faulty chair......this shows utter disregard for Occupational Health and Safety Guidelines.....and also neglect of your duty of care to your passengers.....\nI was given $30 of frequent flyer points, when it cost me $160 to upgrade to seats with more leg room.....\nThen on our return flight that I purchased extra leg room seats (over 4 hours late due to G20 and missing our connecting domestic flight) - you said at check in that my 72 year old mum wasn't capable of managing in the exit row in the event of an emergency.....this was blatant 'agism' and judging a book by its cover......mum's health is better than mine, and after over 40 years of nursing - how insulting......then not only did Qantas move mum, they moved her 10 rows away from me......when there were so many free seats in Business class where mum and I could have sat together.....\nThe food was aweful - hospital food is better; the flight food used to be pretty o.k.....\nThen the poor hostess's are forced to work for over 6 hours in a cramped area at the rear of the plane, behind the toilets, with only room to fit 4 adults standing up.......\nMum and I expected so much better, we're so disappointed Qantas......\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22","403":"Cancelled our flights without our permission and then charged us double to rebook on the same flight.\n\nPrior to even departing we had to spend over 6 hours on the phone to Qantas, being put on hold because they cancelled flights and rebooked us on flights that were too late to board our connecting qantas flights.\n\nThen, while overseas, without permission, they cancelled the return flight and then made us pay double the original price to rebook on the same return flight.\n\nAfter another 2 hours on the phone to Qantas they said they would refund the difference but it would take 6 to 8 weeks to process the refund.\n\nDisgusting, criminal behaviour.","404":"We flew out in May 2022. We have waited hours on the phone many times with their Fiji call centre, you can hear the ladies laughing in the background so your complaints are hilarious to them. They probably put us on speaker for their enjoyment as I heard a transfer and then heard comments and laughter relating to my frustration. They have no idea what they are doing and would not allow me to speak to a manager. Still waiting after 6 months and hours of frustration for a $360 refund for extra leg room tickets that were not honoured and cab fees for cancellation of flight. Allen Joyce was actually on our flight and he copped an ear full at Darwin airport from a few Aussies in the lounge about his demise of the iconic business, nice work boys. In hindsight I should have asked him for the refund when I saw him. Terrible food, cancelled flights and baggage problems we experienced it all.","405":"I have nothing good to say about them. Check in machines used to be good but they have managed to mess those up now. Out of about 6 bag drops, 1 was working - peak hour\u2026.. food onboard is garbage\u2026..","406":"Worst Flight of my life. I WENT 10 hours with no food and missed my flight because they did not make sure I had the right ticket! Another person had my last name on flight so they gave me ticket with wrong name. They told me the food cards they gave me will work on any airline. That was a lie!! 10 hours no food asked for supervisor he said there was nothing he could do. So here I am 12 hours no food!!","407":"is I was mis-lead by being given wrong information by Qantas reservation agents from the call center, and forced to buy point to get an upgrade.\nHad it being the Qantas Agent was professional and took the time to analyze the PNR she wouldn\u2019t have asked me to purchase these points and waste \u00a36,298.40\nsecondly, I tried to book another flight with Qantas but using the points which I paid for 6,298.40 would not get me a business class ticket to Singapore, where as if paying cash I would get a business class ticket from \u00a33,561 however using points they are not enough even though I paid \u00a36298.40, which means these points are not even worth the amount paid for.\nThis looks like a total Rip off and I am not happy for the fact that Qantas agents","408":"Despite all the rhetoric and comments they understand the issues that have made Qantas one of he most unreliable airlines this flight from Melbourne to Launceston was an hour late. Apparently the aircraft was not serviceable so they had to tow another plane to the termina, fuel it, and cater it ( a cookie no less).. It was an old Dash 8 that were first produced in 1984 by DeHavilland Canada and later by Boeing.On this flight the attendant was not that pleasant and overall, with slow luggae delivery it was not at all pleasant. One day Qantas may once again be a normal airline not a budget disaster that no one can rely on.Until Boarding time departure was at Gate 2 and then switched to gate 22, on the opposite side of the airport-great planning and customer service.","409":"Having read all the bad things about Qantas and Australian international airports. I was full of trepidation prior to our 17 hour Dreamliner flight to LHR. From the moment we checked in everything went smoothly.

After a hassle free boarding we settled in to enjoy an awesome meal.Then enjoyed 7 hours sleep on the flat bed.\nA light breakfast then exposed to the chaotic\nTransfer from LHR 3 to LHR\nA horror experience which saw us making our connection with seconds to spare\nSo bad we will avoid LHR in future\nConclusio\nQantas 10\/10\nPerth International 8\/10\nLHR 2\/10","410":"Qantas has gone completely downhill, from service to comfort. This was one the worst trips I\u2019ve ever had, Jetstar would have done a better job if they flew to South Africa. Firstly, there were multiple seats on the plane that were damaged to the point of not being able to be sat on to being duct taped together (I flew premium economy and there were 3 that in that class alone. Secondly, the service was atrocious. We were spoken to and treated as if we were a bother to flight attendants and were constantly told business class to presidente over our requests. The food was also inedible and flight staff took over an hour after service to clear to empty plates. Finally, I saw the economy seats were smaller than that of a budget airline, most people had to walk sideways down the isle because it was so narrow and they do not supply packs with eye masks and toothbrushes anymore for economy flyers. Absolutely disgusting that they charge what they do for what you get. I\u2019ll never fly with Qantas again.","411":"Another clunky and rattling QANTAS flight with an antique in-flight entertainment system that is barely functioning. The aircraft was old and once again we are paying a premium price for a budget service. The QANTAS brand is no longer appealing.","412":"Possibly not necessarily Qantas fault, BUT.... Original flight CANCELLED, then a 3 hour wait....and more - DELAYED. Ground staff kept us informed which was good (and expected). Return flight also DELAYED, making things difficult to be picked up at the airport. Once in the air, both flights were good with great staff. Biggest problem with Qantas was they cancelled flights that we had arranged pre Covid and gave a credit which NEVER showed up in their online booking system when I tried (and tried, and tried) - credits that I tried to use now that it was possible for us to fly again. Despite numerous calls to Qantas (most either rang out or after long waits, I was hung up on) and unanswered emails, the issue was not resolved so I had to purchase flights without the credit. On our return from the Cook Islands, I again tried and FINALLY found someone who actually cares and they arranged a REFUND of the original flights - to be paid in 8 WEEKS or more. Qantas - you can do MUCH better.","413":"Booked BA flights but got put on a Qantas flight in Singapore. Luggage didn't arrive, apparently one bag has been found but no updates on the website for 24 hours and customer service when they finally answer refuse to help. 48 hours later still only got the clothes arrived in. Disgusting cutomer care","414":"It is quite obvious that this airline does not read reviews or really cares what their customers report. The flight was typically late, and customers had to endure an ongoing list of equipment deficiencies including rubbish tucked in seat pockets, filthy table trays and a dysfunctional entertainment system as the Wi-Fi was not operational. The seat in front of me continually moved back and forward as it was not secured correctly. A very budget airline charging a premium price; do not use QANTAS.","415":"Just arrived in Changi on a Qantas A380. The plane is good, the staff are superb but the entertainment system is well past its use by date. On this flight my wife had a headphone failure. My screen was almost useless with no volume control, no function allowing anything other than first screen to be viewed ie no film selection. On search mode the keyboard did not work. We did the reverse journey 7 weeks ago and this time my wife's sound was very poor, and again the screens very insensitive to use. As a final note the bottom of the screens run seriously hot which can't be good on a plane. Come on Qantas you must be able to do better.\nRef QF1 seat 84E.","416":"The WORST service. Counter check-in staffs are RUDE and very LAZY. I also found them RACIST. They also HAVEN\u2019T REFUNDED my money since I canceled my previous flight, and it has been more than 3 MONTHS (8 weeks as they promised). The CUSTOMER SERVICE took forever to reply to my email; IMPOSSIBLE to call them from outside of AUS. I called numerous times but still haven\u2019t gotten my issue resolved.\nThis is by far THE WORST airline service I have ever experienced. Avoid Qantas in your life. And for all the Qantas crew reading this, you suck, man. Improve your quality of service and train all your staff to be more FRIENDLY to the customers. Train your customer service and refund management to be MORE RELIABLE.","417":"We travelled from Cairns to Vancouver and return with Qantas. We were disappointed with the state of the planes and the lounges. Both need an overall , looking very sad, lounges need a thorough clean and update, armrests on the planes taped up with masking tape, some seats unusable , footrests worn in premium economy. The CEO gets a bonus which should be directed to updates of planes and lounges and more staff employed. Overall the staff were good but the Qantas song rings hollow in the current state of the company. Sydney airport is another story trying to get through security with the excessive lines- realise not Qantas fault but all leaves a bad taste and embarrassment for Australians . Other countries do it much better..\nWe try to support Qantas but things need to improve.","418":"We had a set of 6 internal flights booked with Qantas and they all went without a hitch. Flights were clean, on time and with happy and helpful crew members. Qantas certainly helped our holiday to become memorable for all the right reasons.","419":"Got to the airport and realised that my tickets had been booked incorrectly. I take the blame for that and go to the Qantas desk where there are 4 people working only to be told they don\u2019t change flights they do other stuff as one of them said. I then had to call reservations which as anyone who has made that call knows how bad the service is there.\n\nAnyway long story short not one person could help me and I missed the available flight that was still an option due to the stuffing around I got","420":"It all comes back to Management (or lack of), the CEO shed staff left, right & centre and now can't get them back! But he still gets his $$$ bonus?? With next to no staff the check in had several self serve kiosks u\/a, half the bag check in units u\/a & operating slowly. The flight was delayed due to a self serve check in being incorrect and a valid passenger only allowed to enter a FULL plane at the last minute. Yes Qantas overbook every flight nowadays! Flight crew were friendly & trying their best but are hamstrung by executive decisions! 20 blokes boarded but only 19 bags arrived in Sydney, again staff issues. The clincher was on noting the missing bag, he joined a line at the baggage handling section which was short staffed and it took 75 minutes to get to front of line to find out his bag was enjoying a Melbourne sojourn!! All up we spent nearly two hours waiting to leave on our charter bus, an hour more then the flight time!! Joyce is a joke and the sooner he departs for the Emerald Isle the better for Qantas & staff & customers!!","421":"I did not chose to fly with Quantas, Emirates had changed for my last flight and I can say I will never be travelling with them again! After a long haul flight I get to NZ to hear Quantas staff have left behind myself and 20 others suitcases and could not locate and send on the next flight. They told us it could take a couple of days to get our bags back, I have everything I need in my bag including car\/house keys, important medications. I also cannot start my travel without my bag. A credit or something from quantas would be nice but nothing, never again!","422":"Well, the good news is that they got us there albeit late. The snack on board was a tasty pie. Staff on board were mediocre and left rubbish clean up until last 20 minutes of the flight. For once priority bags came off first in Sydney. We got there but Qantas are no longer a premium expensive. We used a credit voucher for this flight and now have no further reason to fly them again.","423":"Flew through Sydney back to Auckland in early September.\nThe flight itself was great, but my suitcase is now a write-off.\n\nThe polycarbonate shell somehow ended up split - I'm assuming the suitcase took a bit of a drop.\nIt's a 78cm checked-in suitcase, so was around NZD 300.\n\nThe resolution process was a delight - took merely 2 months to reach a claim outcome of $75.\nI called in at 25 days and was advised to buy a new one and that I'd be reimbursed for the cost - apparently not.\n\nI received one outcome saying I filed the claim too late, so I had to call and speak to someone for an hour before they advised me to open a new claim.\nTheir system decided I'd taken a domestic flight - ah yes the country of Australia and NZ...\n\nFinally, after following up with a couple more hour-long calls, it seemed to be going somewhere, only to get an outcome literally less than minimum wage for the time I'd spent following this up.","424":"Tried to purchase flight online money taken from my bank account but flight was never booked as Qantas had a system error 7 people I have spoken to in order to get my money back and the latest email told me that they weren't going to refund my money. How can an airline just keep customers money and not book the flight then refuse to refund this is basically fraud why is nothing done. So disgusted","425":"The aircraft staff are great , the new customer service and platinum so called service is terrible , after 23 years of flying with Qantas i am extremely disappointed as a Platinum member and life time gold i have supported qantas .\n\nPurchased three business class tickets prior to covid close down my points are the following .\n\n1 . I had to pay $2000 extra to use the first ticket which i understand prices have changed . I tried to change the ticket by 4 days and am told that will be $2080 is this fair ?.\n\n2. I tried to book again and use the next credit ticket and was told its $5000 extra is this fair .\n\n3. it was cheaper to book with 4 other airlines end up with Cathy pacific at $5700 total business class instead of $8500 with qantas .\n\n4 . tried to book europe for next July premium economy the ticket is $6800 i booked with Emirates at $4500 and had the option of 3 other airlines at the same prices .\n\n5. tried to use qantas points and its impossible to get flights .\n\n6. Called platinum service regarding the Japan 4 day ticket change and the person on the phone didn't care just said if you want to pay i can change if not sorry i cant help you and wanted to charge me extra for a flight i was not changing that was $1200 the other $880 dollars was for the flight i wanted to change .\n\n7. in general they dont care they dont honour the tickets they sold me , i was good enough to leave these in credit as i thought it would help them , but i was wrong .\n\n23 years i will use my credits and fly with other companies and so will my 10 staff .\n\nStephen Thatcher\nDirector\nJustjap.com","426":"My flight was delayed multiple times, all at the last minute. I was scheduled to fly from Wellington to Sydney. Late at night, I received a notification saying that the flight has been delayed, which meant I will miss my connecting flight from Sydney to Singapore. I was later put on another flight 2 days later out of Wellington, and with an additional connection at Queenstown. Unfortunately, when I got to Queenstown the flight was delayed yet again by another 2 hours. The flight delays totalled almost 3 days. No response from Qantas customer service for months. After complaining 3 times, I received 5,000 Qantas points for my trouble. Whoopdeedo.","427":"Very pleasant service. The check-in service was smooth and the lady helping out with the check-ins was helpful. The customer and food service was great. There was in-flight entertainment.","428":"Tickets were booked months in advance. A change had to be made for one passenger name shortly after booking and a new ticket was booked for this passenger. Advice at the time was that the refund would take 6-8 weeks.\n8 weeks later we rang to ask about the refund. Turns out Qantas had \"forgotten\" to cancel the incorrectly booked ticket and had \"forgotten\" to process the refund.\nNow we have to wait another 8 weeks to see if they remember this time.\nI never thought I would say this but there is an airline more dysfunctional that Jet Star.","429":"So I booked a 2 way ticket form Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane for a very short trip of 1 week. First my bag did not arrive on the same flight and it took 2 more days to receive it so no clothes and personal stuff for the first 2 days.\nOn return flight, checked in my luggage in Perth with no issue regarding the weight and size. Lots of issues on the flight from Brisbane to LA. First 1 sick crew member and a passenger that forced an emergency landing in New Caledonia which is understandable however very disorganized planning led to many terrible situations itemized below;\n1- took 3 hours for medical team to check on sick passengers before evacuating them from the aircraft which could happen first thing without wasting time\n2- Pilot announced a few crew members will pass the allowable limits of working hours if they want to continue to LA so we have to back to Brisbane after almost 8 hours. This means QANTAS is burning out the staff to the bone by giving back to back shifts where a 3 hour delay will cause an over limit working hours.\n3- some other technical issues that we had to fly over Brisbane for another 4 hrs to get rid of the fuel for whatever reason that they did not tell us.\n4- almost 15 hours wasted and we are back in Brisbane airport and had to wait 2 hrs in a line to get a hotel voucher. Terrible planning\n5- booked on another flight and during check in, the staff refused one of my luggage saying it is over weight by 500 grams!!!! Made me to remove the stuff from my luggage with the fact that in the original check in in Perth, there was no issue with the weight and they have caused lots of stress and pain with their service and now 500gr is a deal breaker.\n6- lost a day at work and the whole joy of my trip turned into nightmare just because QANTAS does not have a competitor and they can treat customers like this\n7- I am Australian living in the US but will never consider a visit until another airline like Virgin Australian operates in this route.\nBottom line, do not waste your time, money and vacation with QANTAS","430":"Last time I traveled on Qantas I was impressed with the service and the food that was on QF9 from perth just before the pandemic.\n\nBut this time the food was appalling I can\u2019t even find words to describe what my meal was it was a mixture of some beans and gunk o out 10 millimetres thick.\n\nWe are vegetarians Qantas needs to be told there is distinct difference between vegetarians and vegans,\n\nWe only had the vegan option why don\u2019t they have a vegetarian option.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Qantas is cutting back on their budget or just have a poor choice of caterers.","431":"Absolutely Disgusting behaviour from Qantas staff towards a disabled 76 year old passenger travelling from Singapore to London Heathrow all we asked was for the passenger to be allocated a extra legroom seat which we agreed to pay extra money for I spent 4 hours during the night from 1:10am-4:35am trying to explain the most simplest basic option of getting a legroom seat for the wheelchair passenger travelling there after spending 4 hours there have still not resolved our case and our 76 year old passenger is left with no suitable allocated seat I urge everyone to Avoid and boycott Qantas for there disgusting behaviour towards a elderly wheelchair bound passenger the staff repeatedly disconnected the phone line knowing that all we were trying to do all night was to get the 76 year old passenger a seat with legroom at our own cost Qantas staff did absolutely nothing to help our situation we will be seeking legal advice from our civil case lawyer and we will be taking further action necessary","432":"Was looking forward to flying again in business. Check in was fine with a very helpful woman who cared about her job. Lounge was mediocre, that is in another review. Flight was on an A330 with great seats with loads of space. Food was exceptional, the entertainment of a good quality. Good seat and when fully reclined was a delight. Only issue I had were two cabin attendants who were rude at best and took an instant dislike to my wife and myself. One of them was down right rude and uncivil. We are not frequent flyers with Qantas and the level of service they gave to other customers was very different. These two should look at what they give in customer service because in my book, it was very little. The other cabin attendants were professional and were willing to help.","433":"Very rude staff on Sydney to New Delhi flight . Seen staff arguing uselessly with almost 6 people in my cabin including me. Almost all of staff with mask below nose. No etiquette whatsoever regarding customer service. Felt like being on a hijacked flight through the whole journey. An old couple in front of me accidentally pressed call button twice, got scolded like unimaginable.\nNever again. Qantas has gone down the drain that quickly, can't imagine.","434":"This flight QF145 to Auckland was in a Qantas Airbus A330 -300 Business class suite. This product is very comfortable on longer flights as opposed to the Boeing 737 business class seats.\n\nThere are 28 business class suites arranged in a 1 -2-1 configuration. I chose a suite with the seat up against the window that offers more privacy as opposed to every second suite being closer to the aisle.\n\nThe suite has plenty of storage space , power outlets for charging devices , a light and a mid size inflight entertainment screen with plenty of movies , TV shows etc to keep you entertained . Complimentary headsets are provided however I always use my own.\nA small bottled water is also provided in the suite.\n\nThe seat reclines to a fully flat bed but I did not use this on this daytime flight that was just over 3hrs.\n\nA welcome drink was offered before take-off and shortly after reaching cruising altitude the lunch service commenced .\n\nI chose the beef brisket for lunch from a choice of two meals offered. Bread and a chocolate cup cake were also part of the meal service along with complimentary drinks. Snacks and other drinks were continually offered through out the flight.\n\nThe staff were very accommodating without being obtrusive and provided excellent service during the flight.\n\nA solid business class product that I enjoy utilising on longer flight segments.","435":"On 20th October a flight planned for over a year to see my family in Perth, was delay by 36 hours. It was just one big delay but time kept changing and so my arrival plan had change, losing money on hotel. In regards to seat I spent extra \u00a3100 for extra leg room by doors over the wing, but this were people gather for excise the chat, had foot step on many time and should knock all the time. Had to seat with feet tucked in. For return qantas just changed it from direct flight to London to be via Singapore with no notice, only knew as I was checking qantas app. So much stress and anxiety caused","436":"We booked 11 months ahead and reserved extra legroom seats. Two days before we flew we noticed we did not have those seats - but we had never been contacted. When we asked for a refund at the airport they told us to do it online ourselves. There has never been an apology for the poor way we were cared for - I felt like I was an intruder.\nSo we have applied online and waited 8 weeks, and then again applied online and waited. And then called and told to wait two more weeks - and then called\u2026\u2026\u2026 you know where this is going hey?\nSo Qantas have had our $1385.00 for a year and two mo two months now - we cannot seem to get any traction and they go ahead as if we don\u2019t exist. Soooooo frustrating - will be an ambassador now for people not to fly with Qantas. At least I can vent here hey?","437":"My husband and I booked a multiple stop, return ticket to Oz with the first flight travelling Dreamliner direct from Heathrow to Perth. We booked window & isle seat, we wanted extra leg room but not available, although it was for the 4 other flights. We leave in 2 weeks and my husband checked this week to see if extra legroom was now available. Not only was it not available but Qantas have moved us from our booked seats of window & isle to the centre row!!! He has called customer service twice who cannot\/will not help. They say if we want extra leg room we must upgrade. We asked how much but they say they cannot tell us, and cannot upgrade the one flight, we must upgrade on all flights?!! We have extra legroom on the 4 other flights so don\u2019t need to upgrade on them. They\u2019re not interested, won\u2019t help us, an absolute outrage on a 17 hour flight. My husband is 6\u20193\u201d so It\u2019s not going to be a fun ride for him or the passenger with the misfortune to be sat in front of him as they will certainly not be reclining their seat with his legs shoved into their back. Will NEVER book with Qantas again.","438":"Avoid Qantas. I booked in good faith - thinking what better way to get to Australia from London than on their flagship airline. No. Asked to checkin at LHR 4 hours before flight - ok - but checkin didn't open until an hour after we got there - so over 300 grumpy people waiting to checkin at LHR & when they did eventually open checkin there were only 2 desks! Appalling. Security - not Qantas responsibility - was also inexplicably long. Seat was uncomfortable at best - food was totally inedible with \"meat\" that looked like gristle. Couldn't eat anything - even the plastic wrapped cake was dry! I'm dreading my flight home again - guess its just 24 hours of suffering for the sake of visiting one of the most beautiful countries in the world. These airlines need to remember that passengers are paying customers & we deserve to be treated with dignity & respect!","439":"BEWARE having to deal with Qantas customer service on the 13113 number. Have been given incorrect advise every time. Because people were complaining about how long it was taking for calls to be answered they employed a whole swathe of new people in Manila and Suva that have no training or authority to deal with issues. (not blaming these people as they are mostly pleasant) Was told it would cost $99 to cancel, then told 500, then told won't cost anything, but now I am told it's $2000 and Qantas have on sold my tickets for a far higher price and wont book us on a different flight. No money has been refunded either. They will not let you speak to a supervisor no matter how much you beg. 28 calls later I am still getting nowhere. Honestly if you have the choice book a different airline until Qantas fix the mess they are currently in. I can't even fit in all the other issues I have had with them but it is not an overstatement - it really is appalling customer service these days.","440":"my y wife and i, plus our kids had bookings from Auckland to manila on the 22nd September\n\n\n\nWe arrived at the airport by 4am, for a 6am flight, however when we arrived we were told there was an issue with payment on the tickets, and could not fly at that time.\n\nI was advised to go home and call Qantas, which did several times, and kept getting cut off. The last person I spoke to said someone would call me back, which has never happened.\n\n\ni explained I Hd confirmTION EMil nd eticjets, the status showed as confirmed, so how could there be an issue with payment?\n\nIf there was an issue with payment how were we able to get these?\n\n\n\nAthe booking were made by a relative in the Philippines using an Amex card, and he has shown me his bank statement showing the payment to Qantas, so I am confused what the issue was.\n\n\n\nOn my last call to qantas, I was told we were marked as a no-show, which is 100% incorrect, and that comment was an insult to me. I ended up making new bookings for the 23rd of September, and we were able to fly. However I am now out of pocket by the costs of the new bookings(7000NZD0 and completely disappointed by the handling of this.","441":"We had booked ASP-PER but in the meantime the route had been cancelled so we were offered ASP-SYD-PER. So this was comfortable and efficient- a hold up on the bags at PER but that was not Qantas fault ( indeed we made a 35 minute transit at SYD with checked luggage) - all in all very pleased. Thanks Qantas","442":"I am notoriously early at the airport to have enough time for check-in, security etc. Now when getting my boarding card at the check-in, the card already shows that the flight departure for Melbourne (where I had to catch my connecting flight to Darwin) was significantly later, meaning I would not catch my connecting flight in Melbourne to Darwin. But the staff did not care about the fact that I had to catch a connecting flight and did not try to book me on another flight, althoug there were other flights from Perth to Melbourne on the same day that would have enabled me to catch the Darwin flight. Instead, I arrived late in Melbourne, the flight to Darwin was gone and I had to put up with rude staff of Qantas \"Help Desk\" at Melbourne airport who booked me into a crappy, run-down hotel on Tullamarine instead of the hotel right across the Melbourne terminal. And then, despite having booked business for the whole distance, they gave me an economy ticket for the flight to Sydney (from Sydney to Darwin was business class). Sorry, for that kind of money, the service quality and organization is really disappointing. And the staff on the airplane, well, they should get some training from Qatar or Singapore. Sorry, but simply forgetting to serve me my dinner is pathetic and needing a reminder is just atrocious. That airline needs to improve in so many ways. Sad, but true. And when you very politely point out that they created the problem, they get rude and aggressive. The only saving grace was that the airplanes were at least clean and in OK shape and the food was OK.","443":"Worst airline going! Delayed my partners flight by a day then sent him to Sydney instead of Perth and then changed his transit from Sydney to Perth to a day later without telling him! Absolute nightmare! NEVER FLY WITH QANTAS!!! Paid for a virgin airlines ticket for him for tonight. Absolute joke of an airline","444":"Did not let me choose seating on website and ended up having the worst seat next to toilet. Domestic transfer extremely inefficient took 1.5hours to go through. Lost the luggages of about 20customers. Far far from full service airline. Low cost airlines operations seems much more efficient","445":"Return trip back to Sydney on an older 737-800 out of Perth.\nGood\n- airport checkin, security and boarding all great - no hassle,\n- left pretty much on time and arrived Safely - pretty much on schedule MOST IMPORTANT aspect.\n- flight over for most smooth only minor trubulance\n- seat comfort much better than on the flight over, which was on a newer plane.\n- crew onboard were fine and no issues or concerns in this area.\n\nBad\n- for a 4-5hr trans Australia trip this plane did not have any onboard entertainment, it does have Qantas entertainment on their app but doesn't help if you don't have a pad or suitable device (mobile at a pinch),\nCan't understand why they would use this aircraft on these longer legs, should be confined to shorter<3hr legs better 1 1\/2hrs. You can travel international in less time than across Australia.\n\nTerrible\n- food or the lack thereof - pretty full flight and I'm sure Qantas would have been aware of number of passengers on their plane but when it came to food service ran out of choice around row 22\/23 and left passengers with only one option - pretty abysmal\n- Got Worse - the two main meal offerings were a Chicken Salad or \"PORK\" sausages - could not fathom why on a two option meal selection Qantas would even consider making one of those choices PORK. Given the diverse customer base it was completely insensitive for Qantas to offer PORK option and this automatically negated any choice for persons of varying faiths or beliefs from any choice eg Halal or Kosher..\nQantas should seriously look at their menu offerings as it would have been just as easy to offer a Lamb or Beef option which would likely satisfy most (not all) customers needs.\n\nNot being subject to Halal or Kosher requirements due to religious reasons but someone who does not in general eat Pork - it left only a couple of packs of Rice snacks and an apple as the dining option - this was not a Lone Wolf matter as the two elderly passengers adjacent also found themselves nibbling on rice crackers.\nThe chicken option would have been fine but as they ran out of choices - not an option.\n\nQantas should review their menu offerings.","446":"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre canceled the flight to go to perth via Singapour. Without any explanation. No body at qantas desk. Waiting all the night long without any lunch, any help... a nightmare","447":"I recently had the sad task of visiting my nieces and nephews in both Brisbane and Darwin after both their father and also their mother (my sister) died during the Covid epidemic and I was unable to visit them due to restrictions.\n\nOn all flights the staff were wonderful. They were not aware of my grief and the sadness associated with my visits. However their kindness and good service lifted a heavy load from me. Thank you especially to Janey.\n\nI am sure lots of people travel for sad reasons and it is nice to know that QANTAS staff continue to help others, often perhaps without realizing it.","448":"Appalling customer service. We will be visiting from U.K. staying with family in Perth , and had booked a flight from Perth to Hobart as part of the trip. Qantas cancelled the flight and offered alternatives that were not direct to Hobart. These were unacceptable as I have back problems and specifically needed direct flights to avoid additional transit stops. Qantas are aware of this as on the international flights I have wheelchair assistance.\nWe declined the alternative flights Qantas then recalculated the cost of our whole trip and charged us a further \u00a31200 for the privilege of them failing to supply the original flights booked in good faith. Appalling customer service.","449":"My business class flight was worse than any economy flight I've ever been on in my life (and I've been on many!) apart from the one time I was forced to fly with Aerosvit (the now defunct Ukrainian flight with the rudest, most surly, unhelpful staff ever). The staff smiled, and the call bell worked, which were the only two things better than Aerosvit. No drinks were served upon boarding. Couldn't get a flight attendant's attention until an hour and a half into the flight (my seat and tray were filthy and I wanted some wipes so I could clean them). I used the call bell, and the light was on, but they were too busy chatting and simply ignored it. Meat stew -- at least, I think it was supposed to be meat -- was cold and unidentifiable with only partially cooked rice (not joking, I couldn't eat it and nor could the person across from me) and looked worse than anything I've ever been served with them on economy pre-pandemic. The economy food pre-pandemic was ten times better than this muck. I can't imagine that the economy passengers got anything worse, it's just not possible. Really small portion too, with just a tiny bit of fruit and a cracker with cheese. I was really hungry the whole flight. Only wine, beer or water options available. Was told accommodation was arranged for me due to the flight suddenly being split across two days (the flight had already been changed 6 times prior to that, with the return portion leaving from a different city and with the first leg leaving after the second) and surprise, surprise it wasn't. She told me to go to the Qantas desk after I arrived but it was closed. I think the flight attendant already knew that, but was just trying to fob me off because she didn't want to have to deal with organising anything. Wasn't allowed to stay in airport as it closed so had to traipse around in the dark at close to midnight trying to find something. Felt totally unsafe. Cheapest option I could find at such late notice was AU$225(!) because everything else was fully booked. The list goes on. Even the business lounge was serving old fruit salad (the fruit was brown and I didn't trust it) and cold, stale pizza that looked like it had been sitting there a loooong time. Meanwhile Qantas is boasting about how well they are doing financially and paying celebrities to take part in expensive ads. Have been trying to get a reimbursement for the accommodation for over half a year now. Nowhere to upload the form, can't speak to anyone. You literally get put on hold for around 4 hours only to get cut off when the 'transfer' you to another department. Qantas, you are alienating every single loyal customer you ever had. At least those flying domestically. I've heard so many horror stories. I'm not exaggerating or making up anything here. These things all happened. I know it's been a tough couple of years but you are showing absolute disdain for the people keeping you in business. Not good enough! Never again!!!","450":"Solid and good performance by staff, service center and on board.\nBoarding was a bit chaotic. Flight was on time, entertainment quality good. Meals of good quality and choice. The safety record speaks for itself.\nRecommendable but not outstanding.","451":"Avoid at all cost! Firstly it was a horrible plane right after take off went to the toilet and it smelled of wee in the most horrible way, seats are narrow and knee room does not exist. Staff is not friendly to say the least. Will try to avoid as have been doing for years. Food is served like I would not even serve to my dog!","452":"First time over to Perth and opted to use Qantas hoping for a less dramas. Happy to report for the trip over Qantas delivered by getting us all over on time and safe on ground- tick 1. Checkin at SYD no probs (Sunday) sailed through security with no fuss - tick 2. Nice snack and drink before boarding on time - tick 3. Flight over smooth and uneventful - tick 4. On flight crew great with friendly service - tick 5. Lunch meal on route not too shabby and pretty nice,throw in some wine, tea\/coffee and water just great - tick 6. Seat space and comfort well fell down here with pretty tight spacing for 5hr flight but seat for me very uncomfortable across back, too low one if not worst economy seating experience, others didn't find the seat quite as poor - \"X\". Destination Perth, on time easy disembarkation- tick 7. Luggage arrived with plane - tick 8\nGood crossing and overall decent product and Qantas appear to be getting back closer to pre pandemic service levels.","453":"They are getting worse by the week. I fly 24 times minimum with Qantas a year and the downward slide have made them the equivalent of a third world airline. Rude staff, combined with constant delays and a lack of staff to service customer needs have created the 2nd worse airline in Australia after Jetstar which suprise suprise they own.","454":"With the Covid 19 in 2020, we couldn\u2019t take the plane from NZ to Bali so Qantas transformed our money by a credit of points to use on our next reservation. They cancelled the total of our credit and when we call to the clients service they put us in waiting during a lot of time and never call back to give us a solution. We try to call Qantas many many times since almost 1 month.\nWe are very disappointed.","455":"Tried to rebook our flight using the flight credit from our original of booking of 11\/08\/2019, cancelled due to covid. No luck tried to contact Qantas and finally got through to their French customer service who told me our flight number had been changed. Made the booking and had to pay for our seats , no tickets arrived. 25\/06\/2022 called Qantas at Heathrow and was told had to pay an increase in the cost for the new flight, still no tickets. 26\/05\/2022 called Qantas again told the payment was not accepted, Rang our Bank, was told Australain Banks do not comply with European bank legislation for online transactions. Called Qantas ag\nagain and advised them would fly to Heatgrow on 01\/06\/2022 to pay in person at their service desk. No service desk but did manage to pay. Added expense off \u00a3748.44 Still awaiting reply from Qantas head office about our Complaint. But Mr Barnabay Joyce moved into his 40 million dollar home a few weeks ago so has not had the time to read or deal with our comlaint!!!","456":"Virtually ignored on boarding, no offers of drink although I noticed the flight attendants handled around water. Compared to my flight over from London to Perth where the flight attendant introduced herself, offered champagne.\nEntertainment was super but cabin service was poor, I called to ask for a coffee and again was asked \u201c did you mean to call me \u201c not \u201c how can I help you\u201d so the coffee was given by a sullen attendant in a paper cup, instant coffee. Again compared to the flight out where the flight attendant on noticing I was awake, offered me coffee and it was a perfect cappuccino with a little chocolate.\nCome on QANTAS lift yo game!","457":"I know Qantas have been taking a bit of a bashing recently but my experience flying business class from the Gold Coast to Sydney in late May 2022 was as good as ever and a great first flight after not flying for about 30 months due to Covid.\n\nChecking in took no time at all but was a little disappointed that even though I was on the one ticket from the Gold Coast to Sydney to Tokyo to London with Qantas and JAL I wasn\u2019t able to check my luggage in all the way to London as even though my layover in Sydney was about 15 hours as it was overnight they just said no.\n\nThe lounge at the Gold Coast airport was about as crowded as I have ever seen it but I managed to get a seat and whiled away the 90 minutes or so before boarding. The food and drinks on offer are fine given that most people using the lounge are only taking a relatively short flight.\n\nBoarding was orderly and at the Gold Coast airport they usually use both the front and rear doors to board. I guess they are still in Covid mode as no predeparture drinks were offered.\n\nThe crew were friendly and given the flight is blocked at 1 hour 20 minutes and you are probably in the air for an hour they do a great job serving a full hot meal and bar service and the food was great. The seat was the standard 737 business class seat and is fine for the flight to Sydney.\n\nThe only downside was that my luggage even though it had priority tags on it seemed to take ages to arrive but that wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nA pretty good start for my trip to Europe.","458":"Booked my flight on qantas website, unfortunately the money for the flight was taken out twice. Thought I would be able to call quotas and quickly sort it out but I was very wrong. Have spent over 20 hours on hold and on calls with the contact centre. They keep saying that the refund payment will be processed within so many working days but each time it never arrives and the call centre blames it on the last person I spoke to. It\u2019s been 6 weeks and still have not received the money they took from my account back. Worst customer experience I have ever received. Would highly recommend using 3rd party website to avoid this","459":"Arrived on time to be told not able to honour the ticket. Called Qantas and was told we would have to pay as the tickets purchased were Frequent Flyer flights.","460":"I have got my baggage damaged during this journey and I\u2019ve kept them informed via a complaint form.\nI was taken a back with their reply, and simply asked me to claim it from my insurance.\ud83d\ude33","461":"Absolutely appalling 'service' provided.\nBooked a 'round the world' ticket - BNE to LAX, ATLA to LRH & LRH to BNE.\nDue to some unforeseen circumstances I had to call them to find out if I cancelled the last flight, what credit\/refund amount I would be given.\nCalled and spoke to someone who was clearly working from home (dog barking in the background), asked them what cost I would get back, he told me $3,700 - I told him this was incorrect as that was the cost of my 3 flights and I had utilised 2 of them already. Upon asking him to check again, he said the same price. No way was this correct so I told him to leave my booking as it was - NOT to cancel my flight and I would call back later. 10 mins later, I check my booking and it no longer exists! Called straight back and was advised he had cancelled my flight - asked to be put straight back on it, no luck, it was now fully booked!\nAfter several phone calls with different agents, the following morning someone told me they had put me back on the flight (after being told multiple times it was not possible) - but I was now back on the flight, booking had reappeared and my seat selection etc all there.\n\nFast forward a week, 24hrs before take off, try to check in online. Can't. It's already 10pm so I figure I will call in the morning. I call in the morning, advised that I am on the flight, I just need to check in at the airport. Asked the agent to re-confirm this. She said, yes all fine. But didn't sound sure. I asked her to check the manifest and make sure I am on the flight, 100% - after being on hold, told no, I am not on the flight! My only option was a $855 refund. Note, flights to BNE from LRH were now $3,000 each way!\nAsked to urgently speak to a supervisor as I am meant to be flying that evening. Advised they only had one and she was on another call, could they call me back? Bare in mind, I had been told before I would be called back and the call never came. So I remained on hold, 2hours later finally speak to a supervisor. She advised I could now only get a refund of $823. Told her this was not acceptable and she needed to figure out a way to get me home or refund me enough to get home. She told me she needed to look into it and would call me back in 1hr.\nOver an hour later, she calls me back with 2 options, the $823 refund or I can get the next available flight, almost 2 weeks later(!) but it would cost ME $2,000!\nTold her no, Qantas pay for my new flight home or refund me an appropriate amount to get me home. She advised she couldn't authorise this and that someone from higher management would call me at 9pm that evening to speak to me. Again, bare in mind I am supposed to be flying home at that time!\nConceded that I wasn't going to get any help until someone from management called me back, I agreed to this. She said in the meantime to fill in a customer service form online and someone would be in touch that way too.\nDid anyone call me? What do you think...?\nI filled the form in on the 20th Sep, still no one has come back to me. Emailed them yesterday (13th Oct) stating someone needed to call me back by the end of the day. Did they? Again, what do you think...?\nBeyond frustrated and left stranded, I booked my own flight home via the cheapest option.\n\nStill NOTHING from them - out of pocket thousands of dollars because THEY CANCELLED MY FLIGHT WITHOUT PERMISSION!\n\nDisgusted doesn't even cover it.\n\nI will put this review EVERYWHERE until it prompts someone to call me back and arrange a refund of the cost of my new flight, the (ridiculous) amount they said they could refund me and the cost to make the international calls.\n\nI'm waiting Qantas and very much look forward to hearing from you soon with apologies and a refund.","462":"Seriously, pay more to avoid this airline. Feel like being crammed in like cattle on their way to the end? Book a seat on this flying cattle bus. If you are a die hard Qantas fan, I would advise to book business class, otherwise there are plenty of other airlines to choose from who value their customers\u2019 leg room.","463":"Qantas are now dead to me \u2013 I will never use them again unless I absolutely have to. That might not seem a lot to some people, but I have been flying with Qantas since 1980s \u2013 domestic and international \u2013 both a Frequent Flyer and Qantas Club member \u2013 for a massive number of flights (over 1000). Last time we flew Qantas overseas (2018) it was a bit of an issue \u2013 and the problems we had were never answered. Since then we flew Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. Due to Covid, I had a heap of Qantas points saved up from credit card purchases since 2018 so I used them all up for our first overseas flights. I sincerely regret that and will never make that mistake again. The problem is customer service \u2013 not the pilots, planes or schedules. I had an airport logistics issue that needed addressing (yes it is serious) and the local airport has been very helpful, but to get it completely sorted I had to talk to Qantas. All weekend I tried \u2013 web and phone \u2013 no one was able to help \u2013 because it was the weekend was main excuse. IMO their whole customer service 'front end interface' is about getting callers to use the website (and piss off). I tried again this morning (Monday) and after waiting nearly 15 minutes on the QC\/FF number, I was given a recorded message from a non-english speaking person (probably overseas call centre) \u2013 \"we are upgrading our system, please call back after few hours\" \u2013 they then terminated my call. So I rang the specific 'Qantas Customer Care' number and after being on hold for 21 minutes I explained my problem. I was told that I had to call 'Qantas Agency Direct'. I tried the number they gave me and it didn't work, so I found the number online, and they will only speak to registered IATA members (Booking Agents). So I rang back the Qantas Customer Care number again and after being on hold for 27 minutes I advised the problem, and after waiting another 10 minutes the operator solved the problem for me (I hope). When the call ended I was asked to rate the call \u2013 the ratings I gave were about the operator and I gave the highest rating. But I bet the general manager of 'customer service' uses those ratings to say their service is good for his\/her bonuses \u2013 but it is total crap \u2013 I was just lucky to get a good operator. Qantas = best pilots, best planes, best maintenance \u2013 WORST customer service. The majority of people want customer service first \u2013 there are so few airline disasters these days \u2013 extremely rare for any of the big carriers. No more Qantas.","464":"Extremely low quality airline. They lost our luggage 40 days ago and they still did not pay the reimbursement. Stay away from Qantas. The airline has too many problems. There are several lawsuits being filed agains Qantas at the moment. Air Cambodia provides significantly better service.","465":"I flew Qantas to Toronto Aug-September, flying premium economy for the Melbourne-LAX-Melbourne leg. Despite all the horror stories after Covid my experience with Qantas was excellent. The flight left on time, baggage was cleared without any issues, the inflight service and food was fantastic. Thank you Qantas.","466":"Well over 6 hours spent on the phone with at least 6 promises that the refund will be paid within 6-8 weeks and still nothing.\nThey have managed to somehow alter the booking from 2 people to one so they have achieved something. They have effectively doubled the problem.\nI\u2019m sick of all their lies and deceit so I\u2019ve taken it to fair trading\nAny good company could have this sorted out in about 30 seconds. I know my company would but not Qantas","467":"Four of us received serious food poisoning by the time we landed in Europe. A similar event happened to us in 2019, my companion spent three days in bed at a German Hotel. This is a passenger and food safety issue which needs to be treated more seriously by both airlines (Emirates and Qantas). While passenger lives are at risk, we are forced to communicate with web portals and file reference or case numbers, which result in a standard robotic answer that denies fault or a need for action. I have to return to Europe in two weeks and I am quite concerned about any future connections thorough Dubai.","468":"Qantas staff cancelled entire leg of travel by mistake. Admitted liability but did nothing! Spent over 12hrs by phone to try to urgently reinstate but calls were disconnected after average on hold for 45 mins. No customer service and no continuity between CSOs (when you could get one). Numerous continual attempts to try to rectify situation with promises to help but only remedy was to complete complaint form! Left stranded in the USA and unable to return home. We had to find an alternative route ourselves at enormous extra cost. No responsibility or care from Qantas. No point of contact except customer care number which goes unanswered or disconnects. Horrifying lack of service. Don\u2019t waste your time with your disingenuous advertising Qantas - save the money and spend it on actually delivering on your adverting BS","469":"737 seats were narrower than I remember, as was the leg room. However, the flight was pleasant, on time and no luggage problems. The staff were pleasant and efficient. Food OK, given the environment you are in.","470":"Absolutely shocking service. Delayed plane. Then turned around mid air and flew back to Sydney ou to be told we have to disembark and no flights available till the late afternoon.\n\nNow we have missed our wedding tasting, we won\u2019t get the chance to do it again, just a memory we won\u2019t have for our wedding.\n\nNo help from airport staff.\n\nStay away, fly Virgin.","471":"I attempted to book round trip from Vancouver to Perth online on the Qantas website, paying for it partly with a credit I had from a Qantas flight cancelled because of Covid and the remainder with my credit card. I selected flights and filled in my particulars, but despite references on the website to an option to apply such a credit to my payment that would appear on the payment panel, the only option presented was to pay with a credit card. I called Qantas to try to determine how to apply the credit.\nAfter five phone calls spanning several hours I finally got on to someone who \"thought\" they could do it by taking my booking over the phone...but in the meantime the price had gone up by $700. After another hour on hold while they \"considered\" giving me the first fare, they came back and said I'd have to pay the higher one.\nAt that point I gave up, booked a flight for close to the first fare quoted from Air Canada, and applied for a refund of the credit from Qantas. Another hour on the phone to do that. My sense is that the staff manning the phone lines at Qantas are undertrained and that the company has no interest in catering to customers who have even slightly complicated queries.\nI fly between Canada and Australia often---usually on Cathay, Singapore Air or Air Canada. My few experiences with Qantas have been the worst by far---I recommend avoiding the wherever possible.","472":"Had multiple issues with the booking in the months leading upto the flight then had a connecting flight cancelled then delayed with little to no information being provided to the passengers to keep us informed. Qantas were a great airline once, not now.","473":"Qantas - after three phone calls, and two in-person attempts at the airport, they have my 14-year-old and myself seated in different parts of the plane. I first attempted to get this issue sorted two weeks prior to travelling. They kept saying it's fixed and you have seats 10 D and 10 E. Guess what NOT FIXED. I've called all the major news outlets and hope they can get this on camera. The plane is full so no hope of changing anything.\nBADLY DONE QANTAS.","474":"I travelled to the UK back in June, every flight was delayed on my return meaning I missed my qantas flight from Sydney back to Brisbane. At the airport I was organised a hotel room at the Novatel and a dinner and breakfast voucher to use for dinner. I arrived at 8:30pm to Sydney the transfer took an hour to come and pick us up. When I was dropped at the hotel I was told room service had stopped so couldn't use the dinner voucher and my flight was leaving before breakfast started, so I had to order outside of the voucher for dinner and breakfast. I put in a request to get these refunded on July 11th, the customer care team came back mid August requesting my bank details, I responded straight away, haven't heard from them since have followed up numerous times, and received no refund. I have tried emailing, calling with my reference number no responds and i have been hung up on, there is no live chat or any other way to contact them. Absolutely shocking. Would not travel with them again I have no faith in the airline","475":"All problem previously expected and still happened.\nBought international flight brisbane - Sydney - Santiago - Rio, 3 months before my departure date. I was sure that i would have problem taking 2 bags, specially brisbane - sydney.\nTo avoid that i was making sure i buy the tickets from qantas website, not from other tird part websites, and on the process i was making sure that i had 2 luggages included or if i had to buy it, that wouldn't be a problem, cause i definitely was taking 2. No evidence about it was showing anywhere, first think weird.\nBetween i buy the ticket and actually flight, i asume that qantas changed the 2 bags that you are aloud to take to only 1 bag, so I end up at the airport with 2 luggages paying 300$ for the extra bag.\nAlso was asked for vaccination certificate, but is not everybody that is asked for it. But i had it, so that was not a problem.\nI will make sure that i try to avoid at most to flight with qantas again.","476":"Actual flight was with Jetstar! Did not start well as Jetstar cancelled our flight at 8.55am on the morning of our flight!\nIt took nearly 2 hours to contact someone, and to be told no available flights for 5days? Unbelievable, and as we had hotel booked, that had to be changed to suit our flight cancellation, plus a cost of over $450, for an additional nights accomodation, as no flights available!\nIt was a packed plane, but virtually no service and even a cup of terrible tea or coffee was US $5.00! Outrageous, and the staff looked so bored and obviously found the passengers to be an imposition!\nWorst flight ever, never again will we fly Jetstar domestic and definitely not internationally!","477":"This very quick 27 minute flight to Kangaroo Island was easy to check in on line, do the bag drop and board. An easy flight with a good cabin crew.","478":"I have been booked on a series of delayed or cancelled qantas flights in recent months. As part of a ticket which also involves a delayed and downgraded flight to Los Angeles, my flight from Sydney to Hobart has also been cancelled. Qantas initially offered a flight to Melbourne! Not much use for Tasmania. Upon calling them and with a wait of course, I have managed to get onto another flight but once again with a downgrade. Not of course that Qantas by default offer a refund for the downgrade. I should also say that I have platinum one status - the highest.\n\nHonestly if there is any other choice then I suggest that you don\u2019t fly Qantas.","479":"In the good old days, when you boarded a QF flight, cheerful staff would brighten your day with a good sense of Australian hospitality. Well those are just memories now. With the exception of the CSM, Brooke and the Japanese flight attendant, none of them smiled, helpful or friendly. There was not even an acknowledgement when boarding the plane. It really reminded me of my days catching the bus to school. And to think that one has to pay $22K for this non-service and unfriendly service. And since I am at it, QANTAS, your food to the US and back home sucks. Not to serve an entry is cheap skating and the portions would be appropriate for a 10 year old child....\n\nI have flown with the airline now for coming up to 29 years and this is just a bloody shamble. And Alan Joyce, please go and retire so QANTAS can have some hope of being rescued.","480":"After a 2 country holiday my final flight home was a domestic connection with Qantas. Unfortunately Qantas lived up to its reputation as the GBC (a name myself and friends refer to QF). Arrived in Sydney off an international flight with SQ (amazing as they always are) at 10:30am, retrieved bags and joined the QF domestic transfer queue by 11am for our 2pm domestic departure, all the time in the world you would have thought. It took until 1pm until we made it to the domestic terminal. Transfers area was full of people who missed connections because the staff took so long to check them in and they just didnt seem to care, not caring seems to be QF policy. Once we got on the transfer bus the driver didnt want to leave until the bus was full so we sat there for ages waiting, meanwhile pax were asking when are we going as they were running out of time to connect. Once again the QF \"not my problem\" attitude came to the forefront. QF, please take a few flights with SQ, EK, NZ, QR to see how its done.","481":"Recently we flew to London from Sydney. The aircraft required a 'deep clean' and had arrived late. As a result we departed 2 hours late. The communication was spot on until we boarded.\nThis was our first time in Premium Economy and it was lovely. Nice meals, great entertainment and a very comfortable seat. The staff were very friendly and always asking are we ok. If we wanted to sleep we were left alone.","482":"Where to start... I was travelling with a baby and let me tell you I do NOT recommend. When arriving at Sydney Airport the lady at check in was so rude. She refused to take my authorized luggage cause she decided I had enough already. When travelling with a baby I am allowed my luggage, a 10kg baby luggage and 3 baby items. I had only 2 baby items but she still refused me the 10kg one cause she wasn't feeling like it. Lucky I was travelling with my sister and her baby too and the lady that checked her in let her take my luggage. Then on board.... well again had to deal with staff abusing me. When I booked my flight I paid an extra $40 to have a bassinet. I was allocated the seat but once i arrived on board the staff asked me to change my seat with a guy. At first I refused and said I paid for my seat I shouldn't be the one moving. Then the staff starting to threaten me saying they spoke to the captain and the flight will return to Perth and they will take further action if I don't move. I let you imagine my state of mind with a newborn baby in my arms and having to deal with that. Staff were so unhelpful and rude and didn't care. I finally moved cause i had no choice but said I want to be refunded for the extra cost I paid, which they say 'yes of course contact the company they will refund you'. I flew in June and I am still waiting to get a refunded. When calling the customer center they either hang up on me or they are saying that seats can be changed on the day there is nothing they can do.... DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS they are plenty more airlines that are so much better.","483":"Travelled on Saturday 3rd September. Flight was due to depart 3.20pm. Self-check in was easy and quick. Boarding and departure was the same. Flight arrival was delayed by 10 minutes and then another slight delay in getting my bag in Brisbane. Otherwise, a good flight.","484":"Qantas had lost our baggage from Karratha flight to Perth. This item was in oversize along with 2 other items, so not sure how they manage to not load 2 out of 3 items.\n\nUpon arriving to Perth I went to lost baggage service and they had confirmed they had left the item back in Karratha. They put it on the next flight and will contact us when it arrives and will deliver to the address where we are staying.\n\nMy Wife recieved a call that evening but had missed the call and they left a message the item arrived and can be delivered but there was no number left to call back on.\n\nFollowing day I called Qantas 1300 number and it went to a call centre Overseas. Explained to them what happened and gave them the lost property reference number only to be told they are still looking for the lost baggage and will call and arrange delivery when found.\n\nI told the service guy that it's not correct that it's still lost and has arrived at Perth airport ready to be delivered.\n\nI had to tell the person twice and each time was put on hold for 30mins while he tried make contact with Qantas Lost baggage counter at Perth Airport.\n\nI asked if the item can be delivered by 10am that day or if not where can I pick the item up.\n\nAfter nearly on hold for 1hour and 30mins I gave up.\n\nLater that day I was near the Perth airport and dropped into the lost baggage service counter and there was 2 attendees and one customer.\n\nWe had never received a call all day to return our lost baggage and when asked why we can't call the lost baggae counter direct they said they take the phones off when busy.\n\nLuckily the item was there but we weren't happy with the crap service that Qantas Lost Baggage had provided.\n\nIssue could have been resolved if we could call direct or if Qantas followed through with calling back on how to pickup or have the item delivered.","485":"The first leg of a trip to Singapore, what we had heard we were apprehensive about flying Qantas but how wrong we were. The flight left on time and arrived in Sydney with plenty of time to go across to the international terminal to catch our flight to Singapore, and the BIG worry was our baggage but after arriving our luggage was there waiting for us.\nQantas no worries highly recommended.","486":"We were at our gate and could see we were waiting for the Launceston flight that turned out 4 hrs late. We were only an hour late, but there was absolutely no communication. It seemed there was a shortage of gate agents as I overheard a ground worker on the phone. Boarding was a mess and rushed. This was an old plane with the engines near the tail and very noisy. The pilot said the delay was due to \u201csignificant maintenance \u201c it needed. Worrisome words. On board we had a soft drink, cheese and crackers. Not worth paying the more expensive prices Qantas charges. Maybe if they put passengers first, they would have greater profits as more would choose them, but I think Rex might be the best option.","487":"Service was excellent. Staff very professional and helpful. They were able to accommodate seating requirements at short notice. Very knowledgeable about their products, friendly and seemingly happy even at 6am","488":"I tried to purchase 2 tickets to fly business class London to Sydney. The web site was not the easiest to navigate and when I tried to pay using a visa debit card. I got message \" we cannot process the card\" so I tried my Mastercard and same response. I rang Quantas customer service and got connected but couldnt understand what he was saying. I hung up and tried again. This time I could understand but the person was absolutely useless. I suggested I would try another airline. The person said \"fine\". I hung up and went onto The BA website where I got 2 tickets which were over \u00a32500 cheaper than Quntas and my Visa card was accepted without a hitch.","489":"Happened to be on the Qantas app and noticed 48 hrs before flying that a leg had been cancelled . No one informed me . When I called Qantas to work out a plan I basically am left hanging on hold until I hang up - have been trying for hours .\nIve been a member with Qantas for nearly 30 years . Their treatment \/ attitude is just awful.\nDon't even consider using them - this Qantas is nothing like the Qantas we all once knew.","490":"If you\u2019re looking for a stress-free and hassle-free, NEVER EVER GO WITH QANTAS!!!\nALWAYS delayed flights and staffs are unhelpful.\nCustomer service as well are hard to reach.\n\nRefunds and travel credits are scams!\n\nThey used to be one of the great airlines but THE WORST AIRLINE NOW!!!","491":"We booked 2 seats on business class when they were first issued. We went on line 6\/12 ahead to book our seat numbers. When we tried to check in on line 24 hours before we were told we could not check in on line. When we arrived at the airport we were issued with one business class seat and one economy class seat, with no apology or explanation.","492":"Lost bag (incl work) x3 days on a direct flight, ignored my request for any sort of flight credit\/compensation.\n\nUseless communication about when bags would arrive, had work info in them and left anxious and unknown for days. then ignored when asked for compensation\/flight credit for the clothes i had to buy","493":"The flight was fine. But don\u2019t expect any customer service when things go wrong. Impossible to get hold of anyone unless the press get involved. And when they do they respond for a brief period and then you get automated messages saying your case is resolved when it isn\u2019t. I will NEVER fly with them again.","494":"I was mildly apprehensive but was pleasantly suprised to find social distancing on the aircraft. Every second seat was occupied Things seemed relaxed and their were no delays and depature from the aircraft was swift. Nothing seems to have changed about qantas.","495":"Flew ex JHB on 19 September 2022 in seat 20J (Premium Economy) and not only was the seat excellent, so was the service and the on time landing at Sydney. Cabin crew went out of their way to make the trip memorable. Could not fault the cleanliness of the cabin, food was very good and the little things contributed. Well done to the crew on this flight.","496":"After a 2 year absence (covid enforced) flew in a Dreamliner (do miss the old 747) and have to say the service was excellent, and the seats (in Premium Economy) was quite comfortable and legroom satisfactory (I'm 188cm tall). Contrary to opinions expressed in Seat Guru with regard to PE found the change from old 747 economy an improvement.","497":"This was the return leg of my 6 week business trip to the USA and prior to Covid i would be commuting to the USA 4+ times a year on Qantas via Dallas. The trip over is a separate review and the worse behaviour by an airline i have ever experienced.\nQantas are currently flying the B787 Dreamliner on Syd\/Dallas\/Syd as they haven't got all their A380's back yet. The ticket prices were unbelievably expensive being the most expensive by 50% that i've ever paid and nearly double using Delta earlier in the year. In fact it was close to business class on AA a few years ago. The plane appeared to be mainly business people which is understandable given the ticket cost. It was i think probably 95% full. Shock #1 came when i checked in at Cincinnati when i was charged for an additional bag. I had noticed previously on the ticket it said 1 bag but the Qantas web site clearly said 3 bags for flights USA to Australia for Qantas Club. American Airlines check in rang Qantas to no avail with the guy saying they are having lots of issues with the Qantas baggage limits. Now i suspect this is because they have the B787 but it's dishonest to say 3 bags on the web site. Flight boarding was quite efficient at Dallas , the plane seemed quite clean and tidy. Meal time came along , 3 choices - Chicken Caesar salad, Beef Stew and a plant based dish. By the time they got to my seat all the Chicken had gone, i could hear others like myself grab the stew which they were fast running out of. I pity the folks that only had a choice of the plant based dish, doubt Qantas will do anything about it but lift your game on the meal choices in economy. Entertainment on board good choices. I am not sure how comfortable the seat cushion actually is. Was very happy to see my bags in Sydney.\nAm seriously considering other options for my next business trip to the USA which is sad because i tried to fly Australian to keep Australians in jobs. It may be a first world problem to complain about the meals and the baggage charges but when i hear Allan Joyce saying how things are improving it grates me.","498":"Flight delayed 3 hours due to wheel change, missed my connection.\nGuy at destination writes 2 flight numbers at the back of the ticket and hurries me along.\nOne day later i come to airport to find that im not flying anywhere, go to qantas stand - its empty. Call them by the number, they say i flew the day before to Ho chi ming.\nSo i check the flights the guy gave me, and they are to Saraevo instead of Riga. I ask the employee on the phone what do i do now. She says something along the lines of boo hoo, better luck next time.\nThis is not ok.","499":"It is only a short flight & took off on time & we were served beverages & snacks. I have to eat gluten free & they even had some snacks for me.","500":"Why, why, why? Why does this keep happening, why isn't Alan Joyce being held accountable for the sacking of experienced ground staff and baggage handlers, why are pilots refusing to cone to work, why are cleaners and baggage handlers prepared to go on strike, and WHY can't Qantas just get us all to our destination on time and not loose our fkn bags.\n\nWhat an absolute nightmare, AGAIN","501":"OK, well my wife and I finally got a chance to take the holiday we had pulled from us at the start of the dreaded cough cough 2 years ago, and decided we would try for a holiday in October '22\n\nSo, booked our flights: BNE-MEL-LST-HBT-BNE in August.\n\nWe then began notifying family, and making plans for visits enroute. BIG MISTAKE!!!\n\nWithin 7 days, the itinerary changes from Webjet began. We'd receive automated messages via them that QF was asking us to approve itinerary changes or request a flight change.\n\nOur flight of choice was removed, but no other reasonable choice was offered, short of a stopover flight.\n\nThis has now happened to us 8 times in the past month, and we are still a month away from our trip. The original itinerary looks nothing like the dogs breakfast we now have to swallow.\n\nThe direct flights have all turned into stop overs, and our travel time has basically doubled. We were flying jets on almost every sector, most are now turbo props.\n\nThis is a joke QF! The flying kangaroo has become the sculking field mouse, jumping from town to town.\n\nIf this is what domestic travel has become I'll stick to road, thanks.\n\nIf you believe air travel is returning to normal, think again. If our National Carrier is prepared to offer this LOW level of service I can't imagine what the rest are dishing up.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMr & Mrs Shocked Dismayed Disgusted","502":"Great service, friendly staff and that high quality Quantas service we love. Flight was on time . Always a pleasure to fly with Quantas","503":"On the last leg of 21 hour overseas travel, I arrived into Sydney Australia where Qantas\u2019 significant delay in releasing baggage meant I missed the connecting flight to Melbourne leaving me stranded in Sydney Airport for 6 hours following a family bereavement. My baggage came off the international leg totally fine and intact, only for Qantas to dent and smash it, handling it clearly with zero care for the 1.5hr transit from Melbourne to Sydney. When I finally got home, Qantas gives just a small window to raise any complaint over damaged luggage. The process is incredibly onerous and requires multiple photographs and measurements. Eventually I submitted it and after 6 weeks received a response saying \u201cQantas takes no responsibility for any damage to luggage, please attempt to claim on travel insurance\u201d. They are in a rapid decline. I wouldn\u2019t risk travelling with them again.","504":"On all four flights the tray table and seats were filthy. Food left smeared on tray tables and even on cabin walls\/windows.\n\nSeparated our groups seats even though we were seated together when we initially booked.\n\nSeats were incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nFood was worse than most budget airlines.\n\nChecked baggage was damaged in transit (stabbed hole in the side). When I went to claim for this, I was given a generic response that normal wear and tear is not covered. How is a stabbed hole in the side normal wear and tear? I'm sure they didn't look at the pictures. Luckily there was no damage to anything inside.\n\nI was reminded why I never fly Qantas and won't again.","505":"This was our domestic connection after an international flight from New Caledonia. The flight was great with a flight attendant with a personality who gave great service. And they even served a hot pie with wine! A miracle on Qantas domestic these days. See Qantas it does not take much to keep your loyal passengers happy.","506":"We had a nightmare experience at Noumea airport - arrived 1.5 hours before flight and only just got through security as boarding was closing (and we were not the last on board!).\n\nOnce on the plane, it got better. We had exit seats so plenty of space and a free seat in the middle. The plane has good entertainment and we enjoyed a movie. The food was delicious and plentiful - wine was served and we got a Lindt chocolate for dessert.\n\nEven though we left late, we arrived on time. But then the fun started. The pilot and ground crew seemed to be in an argument about the airbridge. They even described it as a \"stand off\". In the end, a tug had a reverse the plane (so we all had to sit down and restow bags), and then reposition the bridge. This is what you get Qantas when you outsourced your ground handling to untrained people...\n\nThis resulted in us waiting for 40 minutes to get off the plane. So annoying.","507":"I recently flew overseas return with Qantas & had several domestic flights during my trip with other airlines.\nThe customer service we received from all Qantas staff was excellent at all times. Staff were friendly, nothing was a problem.\nOne stand out example, was that we changed a flight at very short notice due to an emergency at home (it was a flexible fare - totally worth the $).\nThe representative we dealt with was understanding, patient, fast & took all of the stress out of the process.\nEvery flight we had with Qantas was head and shoulders above any of the other flights. The crews were lovely, funny & went above and beyond to make sure everyone was comfortable. Fantastic experience. I will never fly with anyone else again.","508":"Sydney to Qld. Business class ppl go through Bridge, economy walk down stairs, outside, then stinking jet fuel, then up stairs. $700 return. Dont be scabby and lazy Qantas. Get 2 walkway bridges. Going another airline next time. Why?","509":"Spent all day trying to clarify questions I had in relation to booking a flight. I was put on hold at one point for 2 hours and each time I called back I was given a different answer. The customer service staff are so poorly trained, making it up as they go along!","510":"This flight was excellent. The plane was comparatively new and importantly the Business Class lounge in Brisbane was excellent. The flight left a few minutes early and arrived significantly early; and the crew were excellent.","511":"Qantas is a good airline overall, and generally the Business Lounge is quite comfortable. but unfortunately there\u2019s no Business Lounge at Townsville. The Qantas Club we went into was a little too crowded for our liking, so we just stayed in the terminal. The flight itself was good, as is usually the case.","512":"I\u2019ve always flown Qantas, have always been loyal to them, and have always appreciated the way they operate; but that was pre-COVID.\nWe travel in Business Class, we choose to pay the extra for the comfort and facilities, but it appears Qantas is feeling the pressure now post COVID.\nWhile I sympathize with the problems of staff shortages and resulting flight changes, what I can\u2019t come to terms with is the fact that where a flight does change, our selected seats are then automatically changed. To make matters worse when we try to select new seats we receive a message saying seat selection is not available for this new flight, just an aisle or window preference.\nTo my mind that just isn\u2019t good enough when we\u2019re paying premium prices for Business Class seats.","513":"Australia Quantas customer call (131313) is terrible.\nI rang to +61131313 at Tokyo due to transfer problems from Narita to Haneda with Japan national COVID issues.\nInterracial call waiting time about 40mins, then finally Quantas AUS staff picked call and she asked me hold line , then my call was forwarded to Customer ratings messages without my request not completed.\nThis kind call drop from Quantas customer team happened 3 times out of 5.\nCan you imagine this situation?\nIf you have issues of ticket or Visa in overseas, you will get this problems.\nI bought new ticket from another airline then I came back to Sydney.\nI will never never get ticket from Quantas, which is worst my overseas experiences.","514":"This was the first leg of an international trip. We were using our points. The Qantas lounge in Hobart is quite average. There were also so many status members on this flight that the priority check in line and the priority boarding queue were longer than the regular one! Maybe time to stop the status retentions? I earned my gold...\n\nQantas market themselves as a premium airlines but the reality is not the case. The legroom is tight, the so called refreshment is an awful pack of salsa with chips and they don\u2019t have juice... but I got a wine...\n\nWe landed on time. Bags came off fine. But this could have been Jetstar or Virgin. Nothing special.","515":"Flight to Adelaide was my first local flight since the Covid lockdowns in March 2020.\nSurprisingly all went. The Sydney Qantas Business Lounge standards were excellent. Paper plates because of dishwasher malfunction was no problem.. The flight left and arrived in ADL on time. Qantas inflight service was complimentary and the quality of snacks was excellent. Was very lucky. given the current challenges.","516":"After there usual 2 hour delay we missed our connecting flight to Kilimanjaro when we landed our tickets were already printed for the next day same seats !!! We sat in the airport for 5 hours being given one bottle of water each .we were then transferred to what I would call a one star hotel were the food was disgusting as we were on holiday we went for a drink which cost us 70 dollers for 4 drinks missed our hotel in Kilimanjaro no compensation offered as it was only a 2 hour delay after saving for years for holiday of a lifetime","517":"Good point - we got to Australia in 16 hours, second good point the selection of films was good.\n\nOtherwise - the seat was bearable but not comfortable and the food was poor - of which the breakfast was a\nLukewarm joke. Being a person of size the pyjamas were too small and Mrs PMQ being a slip of a thing, they were too large.\n\nAs per the title, disappointing. Not way of getting to Australia that we will use in future.","518":"I\u2019ve arrived back to Sydney airport at 6am on the 6\/9\/22. While waiting almost 2 hours for my luggage, I decided to ask assistance from baggage services showing them the precise location of my luggage as I have an Apple tracker in the luggage.\n\nAfter showing qantas baggage staff the precise location they failed to get the luggage and instead advised me a lost baggage report is to be developed and I should go home and wait for my luggage.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating knowing my luggage is 34kms away from me with it\u2019s exact location in Sydney airport, and Qantas failing to apply effort to locate my luggage!\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have to wait a minimum of 2 days!!! I have called Qantas multiples times and they continue to advise that the team\nAre still searching your bag\u201d this is agony!!!!!!!!!!","519":"Steady going down hill but today was an all time low.7 hours on hold. Told it would be $2000 to change flights to day earlier so I could avoid potential strike action. Customer service were nearly in tears saying how dreadful it was!","520":"Absolutely horrific!!!!! This company is cutting costs and it shows. They will not keep their reputation if they keep outsourcing!","521":"My partner and I booked a flight to Singapore so that we could return to Sydney business class. When we needed to return home the flight was delayed 7 hours before they told my partner and I we had been kicked off our business flight being the only two passengers due to a \u201ctechnical difficulty\u201d. We then need to go through to customs where once again Qantas failed to communicate and did not provide the form that was required therefore we waited an extra 2 hours. We did not hear any response regarding when our flight would be rescheduled to. Once we called Qantas they booked a business flight on the next available which they then cancelled to place us on a later flight in economy which we had paid a business flight for $12,000. Once we requested to speak to someone from Qantas we were told they were \u201ctoo busy\u201d, the communication has been horrible and no attempt to rectify their mistake, I am appalled at the service we have received and did not expect this from an airline like Qantas","522":"What a joke, sub standard disgraceful service which is easily beaten by economy service on budget airlines. There was no service at all for the first couple of hours into the flight.\n\nThe business lounge at Sydney had the same crap cold (supposed to be hot) food sitting in the food containers for 4 hours and it was unsafe and inedible.\n\nStaff were useless and when you advised cabin manager she just walked off like WTF\n\nBusiness class food was terrible and inedible and they served flat mixers with drinks.\n\nNowhere to complain to except idiots in overseas call centres and Qantas you can keep your cost cutting airline I wont use it again\n\nSeriously Alan Joyce and his cost cutting crap ahs turned Qanats into the low class crappy airline and I will never fly with them again","523":"Delays delays and more delays. How can you relay in an airline like this one! Such a pity Australia has this airline to represent the country","524":"Having received an email from Qantas, with a U-tube video from Alan Joyce, offering a $50 gift on any return flight I downloaded the app and obtained my promo code. I then proceeded to book an international flight only to find there was nowhere to enter the promo code when making the booking. A few days later I received an email from Qantas Frequent Flyer advising me of my \"unique single use $50 flight promo code\". The email stated the \"promo code could be used to make a single itinerary Qantas operated return booking on qantas.com by 30 November 2022, for travel by 30 June 2023.\" I therefore went to the Qantas website and made a booking and entered my promo code. However, after completing the payment I found the $50 gift was not applied. I phoned Customer Support. A very affable person said she would correct this and phone me back in 2 hours. I confirmed she had my correct phone number. I did not receive the promised call!\nAt best it appears Qantas is making it as hard as possible to claim this gift. At worst this is just a deception to get people to make a booking but not receive the promised $50 discount.\nDespite having been a loyal supporter of our national airline in the past, this has soured my attitude toward Qantas and for future air travel I will be looking at other carriers first.","525":"Watch out for seat 44J on the QANTAS 787. Located adjacent to the mid section starboard toilet. So close you\u2019re practically in there with those doing their business \ud83e\udd2e Not a great way to spend 16+ hours.","526":"The seats were comfy and the staff were friendly and on point. The entertainment was great, I watched 1 great movie and skimmed another. The food was bad, really really bad. We both had chicken with soy noodles and it was tasteless rubbish.","527":"The service was awful. The staff were stressed and not very professional. I was dehydrated and went to the back of the aircraft to get water. Two cabin crew were sitting there. I asked small water bottle, and one of the staff didn't even get up. She grabbed a plastic cup to pour water from an open big water bottle. I again asked unopened small bottle of water. They both said they didn't have. I went back to my seat. I was so dehydrated my mouth was very dry. I again pressed a blue button to call a cabin crew. No one turned up. I turned the button off and on again. A while later one of the staff turned up, I again asked unopened small water bottle. The cabin crew abruptly asked where your small bottle that was in your seat pocket give me that I will refill it. I said the other cabin crew already collected the empty bottle. She said that is it, if you want I can get you a plastic cup of water or we don't have any other. She also said we have 160 passengers' small bottles of water finished and we couldn't have hundreds of bottles in stock. I then had to request a can of mineral water. The staff were rude, the service was awful, food was terrible. The cabin crew mostly didn't refer to passengers as sir or madam, it was like \" what do you like?, what can I get you etc\". I will never again fly with Qantas.","528":"This didn't look like an international flight, it felt like a domestic. Service on board was very disappointing and staff felt stressed. only 2 staff were servicing over 150 passengers. Food was awful it was not a standard for international flights. Entertainment monitors were small and not much selection such as games etc. I won't fly with Qantas in the future. Qantas needs to restructure its management and appoint a strong CEO to get the airline to a high standard.","529":"We were finally able to go on our 2.5 month winter escape originally booked in 2020. The trip to Honolulu was a breeze and on time but a lot of passengers simply didn't bother to wear masks or wore them under their nose in spite of repeated requests by staff. Several of the more vocal were Americans and of course there were frequent comments about their \"rights\" whereas Australians in the middle of their winter wave were generally compliant. On the return trip the plane was full and again there were people not wearing masks - not sure what the staff are meant to do and sadly this time the offenders were Australian. I felt like telling the mask free passenger across the aisle that i had Covid a week prior to leaving so should i remove my mask too? The flight was delayed by 1 hour so we missed our connector to Melbourne but we followed the news in the USA and their airlines were having 000's of cancellations so it isn't just a Qantas problem. No luggage issues with our 3 bags on the way over or our 4 bags on the return trip.","530":"The good:\n- Most of my flights were on Emirates who, contrary to Qantas, have their s*** together\n\nThe bad (in order of occurrence):\n- Couldn't amend flights online\n- Did not get value out of my flex ticket as hours-long waits discourage calls to the call centre\n- Had to spend hours on hold each time Qantas changed or cancelled a flight to sort out the itinerary\n- Offered to move to a Jetstar flight when the Qantas flight got cancelled and the rep tried to get me to pay for the privilege\n- Added my special meal request to the book months in advance, first flight in I didn't have a meal\n- My bag ended up in Manila instead of Bangkok\n- No one cared about the above missing bag and when it was eventually located none of the staff were able to get it moving\n- When I eventually got in touch with MNL myself the bag was swiftly sent back to Auckland but Qantas manager to make it go missing a second time\n- Qantas has not responded to any of my messages\n- Qantas kept asking me to supply the information they requested but nowhere specified what that information was\n- Despite not responding to anything, when I didn't respond to something within a week I got a slap on the wrist and they closed my case","531":"We were due to fly from Sydney to Norfolk Island on August 7 and, after a bit of drama, we were told the flight was cancelled . Qantas came up with two excuses before the real reason came out. Our flight had been redeployed. We flew out the next day but were not seated in an exit row which we had paid extra for. Two other travellers that we got to know sat in the exit row but were not charged extra to occupy the seats we paid for. We also paid for exit row seats on the return flight and, when we asked Qantas to waive the charge (in line with the free upgrade that others got on the way across) this was denied. Furthermore, Qantas has not responded to our requests for a refund for the seating upgrade we paid for but didn\u2019t get.","532":"Any Australians that have flown for more than say 10 or 20 years both domestically and internationally will no doubt have some fixed ideas about Qantas. I have seen their ups and downs. Years ago they weren't the best (to put it politely) for their in flight service especially on domestic travel (which I would have to accept would sometimes not be a happy experience for them). I can say that they have picked up a lot in recent times, however some of their staff seem very junior these days and lack a little knowledge of how things actually work. One junior stewardess said to me when I was about to leave the aircraft on arrival at Sydney Airport \"You'll be out soon\" to which I said that would be a miracle once you arrive in Australia (the baggage claim took almost an hour from memory). The older staff however are very courteous and pleasant. As for the food, Qantas is exceptional - for economy class you get a great meal, the vegetarian option being \"world class\" (as they would say in Bris Vegas about Bris Vegas). The Australian wines are excellent pairings. Qantas however is lacking quite considerably in the in flight entertainment. First of all, there is no music. Many airlines do provide music, and there are many passengers like me who love to browse through the music selection and who would prefer to do that than watch a movie. Tell Qantas \"The Day the Music Died\" was not just the title of Don McLean's great song, but a Qantas policy for their in flight entertainment!!! Qantas is to be complimented for including classic movies, but on the other hand, whoever wrote the brief reviews for the movies has no idea about classic cinema (it's as if the reviews were written by a ten year old). For example, there were several Jimmy Stewart movies in the classic cinema section where Jimmy Stewart was not even mentioned by name as a main actor in the actual film you might select. That is akin to regarding Sir Don Bradman as an incidental player in the Bodyline series or believing that Pele was a average Brazilian football player. Qantas, while you may not regard this as important, dumbing down classic cinema is not showing your world class aspect.\nImportantly, having no music at all on your international flights is a great tragedy for a long haul flight. Passengers please don't forget to bring a good book if you are not into movies. Qantas gets the \"Very Good\" rating from me given the customer service and the very good meals they serve...and nothing much else.","533":"Wasn't happy about the rescheduling (plus 4.25hrs) but that's what's expected when you book economy I guess.\nThe flight was very enjoyable. Cabin crew were great, we received complimentary refreshments and a bag of nice passionfruit cookies. I nice touch for such a short flight.\nI think Qantas is the go to airlines.","534":"Our family of four arrived early at HNL airport to beat the rush and agony of check in and security check procedures. Unfortunately we were half an hour too early as the check in counter was not open. Our lefty was scheduled to leave at 10.00am Honolulu time. We also thought we could take advantage of our QANTAS Club membership. 30 minute wait for check in wasn't so bad as we passed our time talking to fellow travelers and sharing experiences. Check in was swift once QANTAS was open but...no Club lounge. It was under re-construction \/refurbishment. They gave us a $20.00 voucher each which we could redeem at any participating HMS vendor store. We redeemed our vouchers with Starbucks. Food was good but the QANTAS Club experience would have been much better. The plane got in about 1hr and 15 mins late due to a delay in Sydney. Boarding was orderly and very pleasing as they seated the economy passengers starting from the rear of the plane. My wife and I sat in seats 46A and 46B. One row back from an exit row. I don't think the seats in this aircraft (Airbus A330) are good for flights greater than three hours. Well it's either the seats or my body getting older. The recline was Ok just the seat cushion was way too hard. Service was good from all of the Cabin Crew. Refreshments where good and plentiful as were the snacks. Lunch was a chicken salad, which was good. Main dinner meals let us down as my wife and daughter are allergic to tomatoes. Our special requests were not heeded and the flight ran out of meals without tomatoes in them. Apart from the main meal issue, we believe we were over fed on this flight. The ice creams were a good touch. The pilots were very slick. Smooth take off and general flight but the landing in Sydney was super silky. They made up some good time too. All in all a pleasant experience.","535":"If Qantas is an average 4 star airline i cant imagine what a 2 star airline is!\nTheir service is so poor its not even worth writing about.","536":"28th August.\nI wasn\u2019t happy at all with the service on this flight. Compared to Qatar Airways or Emirates I think they need to pick their game up. I paid over \u00a39000.00 for this!!! I was in front section business class . Boarding at noon we had one main meal and a breakfast . Snacks only available in between over a period of 16.5 hours\nIn my cabin it took ages to bring the different lunch courses and my main, lamb dinner, when it eventually arrived from the other section was tough and not very hot. I had a glass of Riesling, with dinner, but when they came for top ups, girl said they had runout and she would get from other cabin. I never had it.\nEventually again I grabbed another unsuspecting staff member who brought me it. Pudding, they explained was not what we had ordered from menu. However we could have a rice pudding instead!!! How on earth could this happen. There are only 42 BC Seats!!!\nAfter waiting to see if coffee would be served I gave up and requested a cup of decaffeinated coffee. Again long wait. When it arrived Not hot and Not decaffeinated. After this debacle the coffee trolley trundled in. But if you didn\u2019t have the strength of character to ask for chocolates, or liqueurs ,you would not have been offered them. More like British Rail Tea Trolley service.\nLunch service was finally over by 4.45pm I asked for a cup of tea a couple of hours later. Twenty five minutes passed, it still had bot arrived , so I grabbed the first staff member I saw,, who said she would get it\n. Ten minutes passed, then it arrived. Not hot. Breakfast was pre ordered I had the pancakes with decaf coffee and mango . The coffee was so bitter and Not decaffeinated I requested a cup of tea. That was exactly what I got A cup, no saucer, of tea\u2026.. The food was served on plastic trays , no white linen tray cover or any finesse with your individual salt and peppers, etc as standard on other BC services nothing really that said I have paid a lot of money for this, but it\u2019s worth it. I really hope it\u2019s a better performance on the way back or I shall be asking for a refund to compensate. I certainly don\u2019t think this was.good standard or value.","537":"We Have been using the Qantas website To make changes to our international flights. We were attempting to change on flight and tej website kept saying generic error so we called customer service \u2026 big mistake !\n\nFirstly it takes about 60 minutes to get on somebody on the phone. Then it took another 60 minutes to try and change our booking because the operator did not really have a good grasp of the English language. She was attempting to book us on flights from origin cities we were not close to. It was quite stressful. By the end of the call we thought she may have had our flights correct but we wanted the itinerary sent to us via email to double check. Upon receiving the itinerary it is clear she\u2019s messed it up. We were attempting to fly from Rome to Sydney via Perth. She only booked us a flight to Perth which is five hours flight away from Sydney. So for the last three days we\u2019ve been calling the call centre waiting 30 to 40 minutes speaking to somebody else who barely understands the English language we would speak to them and they will put us on hold and then the phone call disconnect this happened two or three times. We finally got someone and gave them your phone number and said call us back if Nicole disconnects and when she went to put us on the Sydney to Perth flight which we were supposed to be on she wants to charge us an extra $1500. We said at the time we tried to book that last week we were actually due a $340 refund. She couldn\u2019t quite grasp the concept of why we did not want to pay. We asked for a manager and she would not supply managers details we asked for a contact in Australia and they would not do that. The best we could get out of them was they will look at the call logs and booking logs over the last few days which suggests they do not believe us. So we have to put our plans again in limbo almost a week until we hear back from them and I\u2019m not confident they will fix it. I can also add that there is no email for Qantas so you can\u2019t contact them that way and the website which we were booking through now doesn\u2019t allow us to make online changes happen we must call this call centre number. We\u2019ve been spending 23 hours a morning in our hotel room at Mykonos trying to call Qantas to fix this and getting nowhere.","538":"Inadvertently made a mistake with a name for a flight 3 months away and picked it up outside the 24hr 'grace' period. Nope...Qantas don't give a crap about helping because one of the flights is operated by another carrier...and after speaking with the other carrier they said they can't do anything because it's a qantas booking.\n\nWhat a bloody joke. This is what being an Australian company is is it? Extorting as much money out of people as possible for something that costs literally nothing to resolve...and in fact is costing a whole lot of money in lost time and staff billable hours trying to get someone to help instead of just fixing it.\n\nI'll keep ringing up till the cost of hours spent on this in wages is as much as the damn flight if I have to.\n\nYou are a pathetic excuse for an airline and business. I genuinely don't know why my mother booked through you but obviously she now realises any other airline but Qantas is better.","539":"One might hope that the executives at Qantas read these reviews as I for one hate bashing Qantas, once a great airline but now sadly one of the worst. The new 787 Dreamliner was excellent, the crew typically Qantas and on this flight arrived on time, one of few I have been on the achieve this of late. Travelling Buisness you might assume reasonable food but it was the worst I have ever had.The pork chop ( a stupid selection and offering) was a thick chunk of meat that was stone cold covered in a luke warm coating with in oily goo on the surface and sitting on a raw potato and vegetable salad.The entire meal was inedable and not what I expect Neil Perry may have designed and would be ashamed of. For thr price they must do better. This was more than cost cutting but just bad planning and management.","540":"Qantas has always been my go-to reliable airline.....Loyalty doesn't pay....This flight was the first leg of my trip to Brazil my travel agent booked. I received a text message at 9 AM the day of my international flight, saying my flight had been delayed until the following day! I contacted the travel agent who contacted Qantas customer service who told her the flight had not been cancelled nor changed, she told them about the text and asked to speak to a supervisor and they hung up on her. She called back and spoke to someone who said they could not accommodate another flight to get me to LAX to get my connecting flight(Business Class )to Costa Rica. She had a look at other flights and found a flight with Jetstar Via Hawaii which would work. She asked them to cancel the ticket for the following day and she would book the Economy Jetstar flight, their response was we would have to pay a cancellation fee! We had no choice at this stage so we paid the cancellation fee even though it was their flight that through everything out! I missed my connecting flight at LAX due to Jetstar Flight being delayed by 4 hours and eventually got a refund minus a large chunk of cancellation fee which I never got back....what a mess.","541":"Still don't know what happened to our flight, no explanation, very sh#$ House customer service, very poor service\n\nPhsss\n\nUnreal !","542":"This is a long trip and at a minimum Premium Economy or Business Class is a must! With 25+ years flying experience using Qantas as a QC member we were given an upgrade from Premium Economy to Business on this trip. Knowing the problems with luggage, both in London and Amsterdam we made the hard decision to travel with hand luggage only on this 2- Month trip. Great choice and recommended to all travelers! The staff from the moment we came on board to the moment we left were absolutely amazing! Priority check in needs to be reviewed in both Sydney and Singapore as this was not seamless. The new fit out with flat beds and individual 'space to party' (not suggested however) makes the trip a restful experience. What ever Qantas pays their long-hole cabin staff, it is probably not enough!","543":"I have been flying with Qantas for over 10 years, and during that time, under Joyce as the CEO that will receive a 3.7 million dollar bonus this year, the company has gone from bad to worse. The financial losses that the public are picking up the bill for are a seperate issue though.\nAll we want is for the planes to take off and land on time, and to not loose our bags, and qantas just can't get it right, I was delayed a total of 3 hours yesterday, and allnof the past 11 sectors I have flown with Qantas have been delayed, all of them. That's not bad luck, that's bad management. If possible I advise avoiding Qantas and flying with virgin. Qantas isn't a sinking ship, it's a wreck.","544":"This is a terrible airline. I traveled from Manila to Melbourne via Sydney and first bags were delayed at Sydney. Due to this I was told I missed my connection but they put me on the next flight and issues a boarding pass as well. At the gate, I had been bumped into another flight later in the day. The customer service tells me I was late at the gate!!! I asked for an explanation and I was told a supervisor will see me. He just tells me nothing can be done and this happens with Qantas all the time. And he just walked away. The way I was treated was very very rude from Qantas. Zero customer focus.\nThis is a 3rd class cheap budget type of airline that is charging 1000s of dollars. I paid $2700 for this low class cheap airline. Trying to avoid them whenever I can.","545":"Flight cancelled, no reason given yet ? Qantas and their sister company SHITSTAR are no better than a third world airline. The ROT starts at the top...Oh I forgot..It's our fault! we're not \"Match Fit\". It's sad to see a once excellent airline slump to such lows.","546":"F*ck QANTAS.\n\nJust did a return frip from Syd to Perth and the flight over was perhaps the worst flight I've ever been on...and that includes flights Ive taken to New York, Dubai, London and many much longer trips.\n\nBoth flights the AC was spewing bone-dry 40degree air the entire time. Requests to turn the temp down were ignored.\n\nBoth flights we sat on the tarmac for an hour after boarding, and it was so clearly obvious that they waited until we were all strapped in captive to tell us there was delays, when they have been having them non-stop lately.\n\nBoth flights had our seats moved without notification. The return leg had 4 seat re-allocations! Same thing happened back in May. Never mind that we were travelling with an infant child both trips, or that the seating was specifically chosen around our needs.\n\nBoth flights were cancelled and shifted\/consolidated to other flights less than 24hours prior to original flight time with literally no notice other than us seeing the different details when chicking in online. No emails, no SMS headsup. No calls.\n\nThis failure to notify cost us not 1, but 2 prepaid and non-refundable shuttle buses on each end of the trip.\n\nEven the flight attendants were in the dark on some of the flight consolidations. I overheard cabin crew chatting, saying they were completely blindsided by management with no alert that the flight changes until the minute they were on the plane.\n\nHonestly the company has falled from grace faster than a nosedive on a\nstalled plane.\n\nAvoid flying if you can right now, but if you have to, stay the hell away from QANT-ASS.","547":"Booking a flight with Qantas has been the worse experience, I have spent hours and hours on the phone trying to arrange my flight. The calls drop out everytime you get to 1.5 hr on the phone so you have to start from scratch each time, with the members asking the same questions over and over after you have already answered the question. The most frustrating experience I have ever had. I will never be booking with Qantas again. I have emailed and filled out customer care forms and have had no response for 2 months. My flight is less the 7 days away and the whole experience has left me stressed and out of pocket.","548":"Qantas is a joke , maybe they were okay but there definitely not now , arrogant staff \ufffc, poor customer service and there Guarantee to lose your bags, And when they find your bags they don\u2019t have the basic commonsense to figure out who\u2019s they are or how to contact you!! They should give up and try something else!! I still don\u2019t have my bags and there\u2019s $500 worth of meat going rotten in one !! I\u2019m a proud Australian and I can\u2019t seem myself flying with Qantas again, joke of a company","549":"Advising a cancelled flight at 10.40 pm\/rebooking advice received 2 hrs later at 12.40am to fly 8.35am instead of lunchtime was extraordinary - incurring a 6.5 layover in Tullamarine- what a joke. Q staff most apologetic at check in but unable to provide even lounge access to compensate for all night chaos\/stress. What has happened to what was The Pride of Australia and millions in additional funding..Rewards announced today by the CEO don\u2019t really cut it!!","550":"Travelers, do NOT FLY WITH THIS AIRLINE!\n\nI booked a flight from Papeete to Los Angeles that was originally planned for September 2021.\nDue to Covid Lockdown, I had to cancel that flight last September, and was issued a credit voucher.\nIn January 2022, I tried to use my flight credit to book a new flight from Papeete to Los Angeles, leaving on August 19.\nAfter over 12 hours spent on the phone trying to get ahold of a customer representative (since using the flight credit to rebook is not an option online...), I finally spoke to an agent on February 9 who confirmed that my credit could be used to book flight QF3817, since fares were the same.\n\nI received a TRAVEL ITINERARY confirming the booking.\n\nOn August 19, when we were in Papeete ready to check in at the airport, the airport staff told us that our baby did not have a valid ticket and asked me to call Qantas.\nI did so for over an hour. The customer representative told me that NONE of us had valid tickets and that I needed to buy tickets again, when the flight was about to leave 90 minutes later.\nThis is a HUGE mistake from Qantas as I had already received confirmation this flight was booked for us.\nI had NO CHOICE but to do what she asked since we were stuck at the airport with a 1 year old baby and 3 year old boy. I told her she was wrong and that I already had the confirmed itinerary.\nShe charged over $2000 to my credit card for a flight we had already booked! She would not listen to me at all, and was not trying to understand a mistake from Qantas had been done.\n\nThis is unacceptable. The experience with Qantas has been a DISASTER for months, filled with tears and stress.\nI was in tears on the phone when desperately trying to get to speak to someone to use my flight credit and getting disconnected after waiting for 5 hours.\nI was again in tears at the airport when you took me hostage by forcing me to re-buy tickets to board that plane.\n\nI am asking to get this charge refunded, since it was unlawfully applied.\nI will NOT STOP harassing Qantas until I get a resolution.","551":"I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of flying with Qantas in the past. Unfortunately, at the moment, it is a disappointing and, to some extent, an unpleasant experience even for a short flight. In addition to sudden cancellations and delays, the ground crew at Sydney and the flight attendants, definitely lack the caring attitude, courtesy and manners. Appropriate staff training will certainly help with making improvements for a better future.","552":"My wife and I have had 3 unexpected last minute return flights with Qantas to visit a seriously I\u2019ll interstate close friend. Each flight has been cancelled at the last minute.\nWorse than that I was offered a refund or credit voucher and chose the refund. About 6 weeks later I was offered a credit voucher card for the extortionate amount for 2 Sydney Brisbane economy return tickets of $2,100.\nI rang requesting a refund as before and was told the payment would take 6-8 weeks to process.\nI will never fly Qantas again, and on recently cancelling a Virgin flight received a refund in 5 days!\nQantas will lose a lot of customers I\u2019m sure and particularly the national carrier status that Alan Joyce likes to trade on.","553":"Qantas are greedy cants who over book flights then cancel or reschedule you.\nThe customer service couldn't care less","554":"They are fine for flights if you book online. Over the phone, changes or issues they are hopeless.\nAll O\/S call centre and have no idea of 1st world customer service.\n\nBetter to book Emirates or virgin.","555":"I have travelled with Qantas for years. The business class food used to be great, but like many things about this airline it has gone downhill. Basically a cheap dry pastie slapped on a china plate. Dessert was a single lindt chocolate.","556":"Qantas lost my bag on our flight back from Cairns through Sydney, I understand mistakes happen and this happens occasionally but the customer service from when my bag didn't turn up has been non-existent. I was without my bag for a week and heard nothing from the airport (despite attempting to contact them everyday) until I received a text message saying it was going to be dropped at my doorstep half an hour before and then a lady in normal clothes turned up and dropped my bag without checking my ID or anything to say I was who I said I was. Throughout the week I double, triple, quadruple checked on what I was entitled to money wise through the essential items I needed to buy. I am a student who has very little extra money and after saving up for the trip to see family that I hadn't seen in 3 years the money I had leftover was the remainder of my savings. I have been led in circles, the call centre has given me different information each time I call and has given me inactive numbers and methods of contact that don't work. I was told that I would receive my refund in my bank account within 24hrs twice by staff of the call centre and that was over a week ago. I have medical bills piling up and had that money tucked away for things of that nature. I decided that I would go through the small claims court but Qantas won't provide me with any contact that I can send my claim to. I am fed up that they aren't taking care of their customers and I will never travel with them again.","557":"Absolutely amazing! So much better then Jetstar or Virgin. I have always tried to go back on them since we were allowed out of lock down. All the staff were helpful and nice. The food was amazing and I have 0 regrets. We went from Melbourne to Singapore for a week and we could easily tell that they were so much better then the other airline we used. This is a number one airline to go to. You won't regret it.","558":"Beyond terrible, unorganised, unprofessional, and horrible service. Over priced\nFly with Rex, above exceptional","559":"Grumpy and unhelpful air hosts - better on Virgin - not fun after a long day. Perhaps some training in manners?","560":"I normally don't go out of my way to write bad reviews but recently had a very bad experience with Qantas over flight booking. Went through three different people and in the end my flight was not properly booked. The first person hung up whilst we were finalising my booking, the second person provided me with the wrong reference number and the third person did a double booking and hung up. Wasted over a hour with 0 results. This is also not the first time I've experienced this type of situation with them. I do not recommend this airlines.","561":"Hi\nI am a gold member and have been travelling with Qantas for many years. This was my first flight since COVID restrictions were softened. I had planned to travel on the A380 knowing it was highly likely I could get a business class upgrade as when I went to purchase a business class seat their were still many available. 24 hours before my flight Qantas changed the plane and positioned my next to the toilet on a 787. There was nothing dreamliner about it. I was sleeping when the dinner service came around and when asked if I could get a snack\/dinner the hostess its too late and told me to wait for the Ham and cheese sandwich in an hour. After waiting for 2 hours I ask for it and the gave me a cardboard box with a soggy sandwich. I asked for a soft drink and the response was go to my seat and we will give it too you. Then when waiting for my luggage it was one of the last out even though I was a priority traveller. The whole travel experience on Qantas was the worse I have had with Qantas. After travelling many times to USA preCOVID with a positive experience and now post COVID my experience was very poor.","562":"First time travelling with Qantas in several years and its clear the business class standard has dropped considerably.\n\nWe travelled London wgtn return and the service was very average on all six flights. Is it a case of staffing levels I am not sure. the seat and entertainment were good. But with the exception of one leg, staff we basically absent in the cabin. From Syd to Sinapore, an eight hour leg I saw staff only 3 times. Toliets were dirty after an hour in the aircraft. Any request that did not follow their routine was not possible. Food was okay, but snacks ran out pretty fast. Cheap cheap cheap\n\nSydney qantas lounge only had one food station open and with a very restricted set of food. The Singapore louge on the other hand remains awesome\n\nMaybe unrelated to Qantas, but the Intl transfer at Syd was insane. It took over 60 minutes due to so many people going through one security line. Apparently this is normal.\n\nTo top things off our luggage was lost in london on the way home. Way to go.\n\nwont be taking the risk for sometime","563":"Must say from the moment step in to airport Qantas staff was very helpful and doing the best even the experience staff shortage ! My flight to Singapore was very pleasant ,and the flight crew was absolutely fantastic professional and polite with smile ! the meals service start with service of drink and snack then after we had three sort of meal to choice then before landing small meal to choice from two type ! All meals was testy ! What i can say only that the seats was very small and looks like Qantas put more seats feel crowded with no place for legs ! Also they don\u2019t service any more meals on try with bread roll salat etc is all cost saving but you not going to be hungry ! I will chose Qantas if the price is good otherwise prefer Emirates","564":"Sadly Qantas is joining the rest of business's with cost cutting and no care attitude. Booked three months prior online, just as International flight were reintroduced. Choose seats then 6 weeks later seats dropped off, after five hours over 3 calls to Qantas seats could not be confirmed in Premium eccon & all 3 calls to Fiji were rude and cold. I had sent 2 letters to Syd HO and to this day no reply. Flights changed before departure to suit Qantas of course then on arriving at Perth for flight to Rome there were two more delays ( 90min) and all done by SMS as no staff at terminal until 40mins before dep. Then when seated to our astonishment the wings had multiple large patches of 100 mile an hour tape & clearly not new as very well worn., See attached photo","565":"To get from Perth to Hobart took three flights. All good, it is what it is. However Qantas is now worse than during the COVID restrictions. Not one of the 6 flights of this round trip departed on time.\n\nThe delays caused in no small due to airline polices introduced by senior management and with cabin crew bearing the result. We bored and for 45mins a number of passengers blocked the isle fumbling, tring to find a place to put their bags! Crew asked if bags could be brought forward for checking in and insted this fumbling continued.\n\nCabin crew is the ONLY resason they did not get a one. I looked out the window after taking my seat to see ground handlers throwing luggage at two different airports, Melbourne being the worst. Inflight meal boxes (Breakfast hot) not good.\nfor the price I expect better.\n\nThe terminals for Qantas are another bain. Melborne is a Unpleasant if not horid experience. Adelaide, walk down the othe end of the terminal and visit Virgin, friendly and welcoming seating and eating. Perth terminal was equally unimpressive.\n\nFrom the top to lower management - you need to lift your game as I will choose Virgin any day over either Qantas or Jetstar ANYDAY. Example would be to make check in on all hard cabin luggage when flight fully booked, (reducing loading\/turn around times)\n\nQ","566":"Worst air line ever, i would never ever purchase or even fly with free Qantas credits with this airline ever again. I have been on holidays for 5 days without my luggage and no one has any idea where it is. I would recommend everyone to fly with another airline unless you want to have a terrible holiday. Im stuck in another country without any of my belongings. No support or help from Qantas. There's clearly some really big problems with this company.#worst customer service #worst airline ever","567":"Rude ground staff, not helpful. Seem so uninterested in their jobs. The food is absolutely terrible. \ud83d\ude1e","568":"We had a business class RTW award booked for November but now can't travel. We cancelled it online in July. This is 315,000 points x 2 and $2300 of tax. Recently, we had 2 other refunds come through in 48 hours so were hoping that things had changed for the better with Qantas refunds. But clearly not. I am dreading calling them... it is so stressful.\n\nAnd they still owe me two credit card fees from the previous cancellations which THEIR terms and conditions say they must refund when you cancel award tickets. So that is another things to chase. I am a GOLD frequent flyer and have already emailed them - got a reference number but no reply.\n\nHopeless airline.\n\nWe are now booked on SkyTeam flights and will avoid Qantas for any international travel in future.","569":"I could not be more pleased at Qantas\u2019 service. Not only did they get us (incl 9 mth old baby) and all our luggage to the US without any delay, but also arranged a piece of luggage we had left at security in Canberra sent to us in Austin at no charge, and without any issues! Very impressed :)","570":"Booked $10,000 worth of flights for an around-the-world trip for June 2022. Four months prior my partner needed emergency back surgery and we had to cancel. Customer service never answered the phone (on hold 3 hours +) and emails were never answered. Had to fight to recover funds from my travel insurance. Complete rubbish. As a 25 year Qantas member I will be cutting my my membership card and posting it back to Qantas. Complete Crap.","571":"After a decade of flying exclusively Qantas, and making sure all my overseas visitors did the same, I am switching to Virgin.\n\nIts incomprehensible how bad Qantas has become after Covid.\n\nLike SO many others, flight credits disappeared, booking reference numbers dont exist, overseas call centres are unhelpful as best - often rude, flights have become exorbitantly expensive (just booked Virgin gold Coast to Syd return for $125, Qantas $400), in-flight experience lack luster.\n\nI was in Mexico when Qantas cancelled all their flights due to Covid. Using the \"credit voucher\" was a joke. No credit online so you HAVE to call to use it. But no one answers the phone, calls regularly drop or the attendant hangs up on you. Multiple times were given NEW credit reference numbers that could only be used if we rang back.\n\nFinallllllly booked overpriced flights using our credits and paying the difference, SHOWED UP ON BANK STATEMENTS, and then got a call at 7pm THE NIGHT BEFORE OUR FLIGHT saying the booking was pending because we hadnt paid. I was driving so couldnt retrieve my bank statements and attendant wanted $5,000 on the spot. She promised to call me back in 15 minutes when I was at my computer. NO CALL. Spent the entire night on hold, calls dropped, hung up on. Eventually just drove to the airport and spoke to first Qantas humans we could. They were hardly any more helpful or sympathetic. Said we never paid for our flights, refused to consider my bank statements. Charged us the price of the flights THAT day, rather than the price we booked at. Had no choice but to hand over our credit card.\n\nHOURS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.\n\nWhat a joke. Felt like dealing with an overseas budget airline.","572":"A flight from Melbourne to Tokyo was booked for late September, all money's paid and the trip planned.Mid-August, without explanation Qantas cancelled the flight with no alternatives provided.They sucked customers in , took their money and now the issue is to retieve the costs, including the credit card fee promptly. and make alternatibve plans. One might expect that will take time and be an issue.Alterntive flights have been booked with JAL, an airline you can rely on.No longer can you trust Qantas-- a sad situation for a once great airline.","573":"Buyer Beware! Qantas is currently printing money by downgrading Business and\/or Economy seats to Economy with no refunds - the call centre believes that flight is equivalent if you still end up in the same place! Regardless of the thousands of dollars they force you to lose. No refunds for downgrading, however if you want to get your premium economy seat back you can pay more for it. Qantas needs to be investigated. Royal Commission into unfair and unethical practices to make people pay twice for the same flight by downgrading and then charging again to get your original premium service returned.","574":"Originally due to fly out to Aus for a wedding however C19 struck. Ok not their fault that Qantas had to cancel the flight and all seemed good as they offered a 3 year voucher. However come the day I tried to use it Web site crash. That was February 2022. Qantas Customer Care Team acknowledged within the week then went silent. Next I heard was 100 das later with a survey to see how they did! I have full email trail but so far zero results. Missed the wedding, christening and now missing \u00a32k - with no worthwhile communication.","575":"Good luck trying to get a refund from this business! I have had a shocking experience (and it\u2019s still ongoing) with what should be a high rating\/performing Australian iconic business. Ten weeks after flying I am still trying to have a human being to actually confirm that my request for a $260 refund (payment for extra legroom that wasn't delivered) is actually in their system. I have now made 3 verbal requests and 2 online requests for this refund but there appears to be no evidence of these requests ever being made!!! I have now been disconnected 6 times in over 10 hours of phone calls with customer service. In this case it is not about the actual amount of money involved but what appears to be Qantas\u2019 policy to make it as difficult as possible, if not impossible, for customers to get their money back!!!","576":"We had some ticketing issues. We spent 16 hours (I kid you not) over three phone calls to offshore call centre. Approximately 4 hours of each call was spent just waiting in queue to be answered. Once we were answered unfortunately we were dealing with someone whom was obviously inexperienced and\/or poorly trained and\/or incompetent. They also struggled to understand my Austalian\/English accent and I suspect had never been on plane in their life as they demonstrated no grasp of our situation. As a life time gold frequent flyer I was pretty sure what I was requesting to be done could be done but in each case there go to answer was \"we will need to cancel your ticket and reissue it\". Which I could accept except each time that meant putting new airfares onto my credit card whilst waiting 12 weeks for prior one to be refunded. We ended up with over $40k airfares on our card! What is worse, even after all of that it was still not right! I eventually managed to find the number of the Australian Call Centre in Hobart. As i suspected, our issue could be dealt with and furthermore it was completely resolved in 16 minutes. These are not exaggerations: 16 minutes to remedy from Australian call centre vs 16 hours to make matters worse in offshore call centre.\n\nThe QANTAS brand is being destroyed by whomever made the decision to send their call centre offshore. I will only be using them as a last resort for International travel from now on vs being our airline of first choice previously.","577":"First time at an airport and on a plane since COVID took over our lives a couple of years ago.\nHad to quickly shoot over to WA for work.\nI had heard terrible story's about lost luggage etc, so I took carry on only (I was only there for 48 hours).\nAbsolutely no problems with anything on the flight there, and the return flight was only delayed by 15 minutes which was no issue's for me either.\nMaybe I was just lucky??","578":"Flying via Sydney, I booked an early morning flight with the intention to arrive before sunset.\nFlight got delayed and got bumped to a much later flight - now sitting stuck in Sydney for the next 8 hours with nothing but a $30 voucher and with a condescending \"apology\" from their all but helpful staff.\n\nNot the worst experience though. In my previous flight I got charged twice for my tickets and after a 3-hour wait on the phone followed by a 6-minute conversation, the very unhelpful call centre agent hung up on me.","579":"After arriving at the Sydney domestic airport, we needed to check in our baggage and fly back to Brisbane. After hours of waiting in line, the Qantas staff simply said we'd missed our flight and gave us a set of numbers to call Vietnam Airlines for help. It's absolutely absurd because Vietnam Airlines was on time and Qantas simply cast the blame and refused to hold themselves accountable. They even said we should have raised our hands to tell them we were late at the beginning, which makes no sense considering the first thing we did before joining the line was told their staff we were going to be late but it was them that told us to join other passengers in line and that's the main reason we missed our flight. The worst part is that they refused to re-book our tickets for another flight and failed to acknowledge their fault. It doesn't matter if you have spacious legroom, comfortable seats, or good food, they all fail before good service. How would you expect customers to experience all that when you can't even get your customers on the flight? I actually had a really decent trip before all the chaos and blaming game happened at the Sydney airport. So thank you very much for ruining my entire trip, Qantas Airlines.","580":"QANTAS has massively declined. The Board needs to hold CEO Alan Joyce responsible and fire him. Getting onboard was terrible. No customer service pre getting aboard. Onboard staff were nice people, trying in difficult circumstances.","581":"In recent times I flew to Rockhampton with QANTAS. My forward journey actually went really quite well...as always the catering is exceptional on QANTAS flights. Staff on both forward journeys were professional and as you would expect.\n\nOn the return journey, I asked if I could change my last flight because I would be in Brisbane all day ( and it was cold and overcast) ... the staff at check in could not help, suggested I call a number and then said if I booked with a third party, then nothing could be done unless I called them. This bit perplexed me as they already had my money, I was not requesting a refund and I was prepared to pay more if necessary. Not upset with the staff, confused by processes at this point.\n\nThe early flight out of Rockhampton ran late, but we were advised of this. Of the four flights I am rather sure it was this third one ( although it may have been the second) where they left it late serving drinks and almost didn't make it through the small plane... but that is just a misjudgement of time.\n\nThe fourth flight was the messy one. I arrived back early from being in Brisbane City to be advised it was late. About an hour late. I can't change that, neither can the staff nor the airlines. There might be safety issues.\n\nBut the flight continued to be later and later and no advice was given. The boarding time on my phone and the boards at the gate remained the same and we boarded 20-30 minutes after that. This is where it got a bit sloppy. And that last flight it felt like we had a school ma'am running it... she could very well have been a military officer in the War, but not on our side... I have never been on a Qantas flight where the staff were anything like this. This flight may have ran late... which again, would have been outside their immediate control... but being advised is appropriate and considerate. As for the staff... maybe they bought their military leader out of retirement... I understand they are short on staff.\n\nAll in all the first three flights were as expected to Qantas' level of service... and it was indeed a pleasure to fly with them. The fourth flight... seriously felt like I should be in a trench with a hard hat ready to shoot.","582":"No complaints here, seats very comfortable w enough leg room. Food was surprisingly good and service excellent.","583":"Horrible service and customer service. Had delays on both too and return flights of holidays causing missing connection flights on Qantas. Had to stay over night twice at hotels in connection airports.\nDid not get any notice of this either till trying to check into follow on flight.\nBeyond disappointed. Ruined our wedding in new Zealand","584":"Unbelievable how hopeless the qantas system is. The staff are doing there best to help but are unable to.\nManagement\/ procedures are a let down","585":"It gets worse every day at Qantas, once a great and proud airlline and one I was happy and pround to fly. Over a number of flights taken in recent months, the baggage check in machines in Melbourne have many that did not work and if they do they failed to print a baggage tag. If they cannot get a baggage machine to work, how about aircraft maintenance. Every flight taken has been late from half an hour to more than an hour, all one might expect could have been avoided with better management. One flight they changed the flight number without advice and this caused confusion at the arrival end. A damaged bag on one flight still has not been resolved after six weeks have lapsed. The flight to Perth had the most revolting example of airline food I have ever seen. It was inedible cardborad box of scrambled egg, sausage and a bean and tomato mix in which floated something that claimed to be a hash brown.Total waste of time and better not to serve and save the money. I doubt management read these reviews but someone should and act--it does not have to be so bad.","586":"No longer the pride of Australia. Help desk staff hang up on you after they are not trained to answer questions.\n\nI had my return flight cancelled and rebooked 3 times in one day. Pathetic.\n\nWILL NEVER FLY WITH QANTAS AGAIN","587":"Crap Airline, nothing to do. Plane was dirty, and the flight attendants were rude. Qantas has got to be the worst airline I've ever flown on.","588":"Qantas charged my family and I $600 each including a 15 month old baby after our flight with Jetstar was cancelled. I understand about supply and demand but this is ridiculous. You can't justify this. This is why a lot of people don't travel domestically. There needs to be some regulation so that airlines don't take advantage of desperate travellers who need to fly.","589":"I have so much to say about this experience and it starts with Jetstar as well as a cancellation that was made by Jetstar\/Qantas. I originally made the reservation through hopper. The first leg of the flight was Jetstar the second leg of the flight was through Qantas. When I received a notification for my flight being cancelled it was from Qantas even though it was a Jetstar flight. At first I didn\u2019t think anything of it because they are sister companies. Then I tried to call them, they told me that they couldn\u2019t help me with my reservation because it was through Jetstar, they gave me the number to call for Jetstar. Then I called Jetstar, they said they couldn\u2019t help me because it\u2019s Qantas that cancelled it and that I booked through a booking agency. The booking agency had no information about anything but had to contact them to get it. Mind you this is all less than a week away from my trip. Then when we figured out the flight that needed to be rebooked Qantas\/Jetstar lagged so badly that I couldn\u2019t even confirm online and get my boarding pass because of how close to my departure it was. Then I get to the airport and the flight was delayed by an hour and a half. Then they moved me from the seat that was at the upper area of the plane to the back with me being one of only a few who had an international connection. I had requested a vegan gluten free meal option they gave me banana bread that was made with egg and wheat and lunch was butter chicken. I was so hungry I ended up eating the rice that was in the lunch. The jet star plane was DISGUSTINGLY DIRTY! We might have all been given Sano wipes and made to wear masks (which I\u2019m fine with it when it makes sense) but those things don\u2019t help when you\u2019re in a filthy plane that has air circulating through vents that aren\u2019t cleaned! The vents were caked in black dust, the seat backs had splatter marks from something that extended to the ceiling, the seat backs were full of trash, the floor had food crumbs and other debris (see photos), the wings of the plane were covered in duct tape (see photos). Once we landed there were no staff to help direct people who had never been to the Australian Sydney airport and no signs anywhere to direct you to the correct area for connection. My flight landed as the connection was supposed to be boarding. When I finally got to the gate they couldn\u2019t find my return flight. We had to jump through hoops to finally find it. When I got on the Qantas flight it looked nice and I thought things were finally looking up for me. They had blankets and headphones and the seats appeared comfortable and roomy. I had requested a window seat, they gave me an aisle one but no big deal it was a shorter flight, at least it wasn\u2019t a middle seat. The man seated in front of me laid his seat all the way back and was practically in my lap. So I went to put my seat back to get some distance and be more comfortable, turns out my seat was broken and couldn\u2019t be fixed. They didn\u2019t offer to move me or help in any way. I decided it wasn\u2019t worth fighting about and returned to my seat only to find that my head phones were broken. They replaced those. I went to go and put on a movie and the selection had a maximum of around 10 or so things as did the TV option. Luckily my neighbor \/seat mate was friendly and we all got to talking so we made the best of things. Of course meal time came and they were serving all meat options and when I asked about my vegan meal they said I needed to order that ahead of time I told them I did and they shrugged it off. Then I arrived in Bali, excited to embark on my journey to a beautiful place and go on my much needed yoga retreat, I stood there waiting my my luggage \u2026 you guessed it\u2026 it never came. I went to the lost and found as per what you are supposed to do when an airline can\u2019t get their crap together and is clearly incapable of competence throughout the entire organization. They had me write down my details claiming they were unable to locate my bag location based on the tag I gave them (you know the one they give you for bag claim that they generate ) and gave me 40.00 worth of rupiah with a consolation \u201cgoodie bag\u201d with an oversized tshirt and pants that are the latest in prison fashion (I don\u2019t care about this it was mostly funny at this point) a long with some helpful toiletries which was nice but no replacement for the things that I packed and needed for this trip in order to participate in this retreat. Nonetheless I kept the faith that they would find my bag based on the information I wrote down for the woman at the desk. The next day, no luggage. I got curious about who I could contact and then I found the online portal that gave me the online option to check my bag\u2019s status. Boy am I glad I found that (which btw nobody explained to me that this existed) . The woman who entered in my information COMPLETELY FAILED at entering everything I gave her. It was as though they just made up what kind of bag I had and they let a toddler enter my information. They put in that it was a dakine bag that was soft and had a pull out handle while also putting in that it was a hard case. They never gave me the option to put in the kind of closing it had so they made that up too. I fixed the details of the bag and added in what was inside the bag to see if it would help. The computer won\u2019t allow me to change the suitcase material option to hard case but still has the option selected that is in a different area that says hard case so hopefully they will figure that out but I\u2019m not hopeful. I wondered why I hadn\u2019t gotten a status update this morning so I went back in and saw the Orion to check you contact information\u2026 OH MY GOD ! They had my name wrong, my home address wrong, my email wrong, my phone numbers country code wrong, it said I wasn\u2019t contactable (no kidding with all of that wrong information) they had all of my hotel details wrong they also said \u201cdeliver to this address\u201d for my home address even though they told Me it would be delivered to my hotel when it arrived. I updated all of the information in the system but have very little hope that my bag will ever be found and once someone sees everything that is in there I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it gets stolen. I am stuck in Bali with no clothes, no camera lens that is my profession, and no ability to reach anyone. I will never, as long as I live, EVER fly Qantas or Jetstar ever ever everrrrrrr again! If you care about your sanity, do NOT fly this airline ever! They should shut this company down! I started with a 2 star rating because the flight attendants at the counter were nice and helped me even though when I was trying explain things they kept cutting me off and preventing me from explaining why the reservation was so messed up. I have since updated it to show 1 on account of the baggage issues and situation involved with that. If I could give negative stars I would. I work in the medical profession as well and let me say this, if I was as bad at my job as these people are at theirs, lives would be lost and I wouldn\u2019t have a job anymore. Do better humans. This is beyond not ok.","590":"I booked business class flights with qantas. They were cancelled both ways days before the flight. When trying to contact Qantas i was repeatedly hung up on. I spent over 15hr on hold without an outcome. This is not the airline to fly now! I've had better flying experiences from the super budget airlines at the moment. I really hope qantas can be Australia's number 1 again but this has bee more than disappointing . I won't be flying this airline again","591":"This is my first time flying with them and the supposed to be a lovely holiday ended into a dreadful disaster. Our flight was cancelled last minute, and had to cancel work shift that they won\u2019t even compensate! They booked us a hotel to stay in and put the wrong address. Had to get off the taxi and walked all the way up the hill at 12 midnight because they put 20 instead of 200 on the address. Very disappointed and won\u2019t fly with them ever again. Will go back flying with virgin instead. Terrible! Terrible! Stay away from them. We paid more expecting better service than Jetstar but was given with way worse option.","592":"Cancelled our flights, different flight options offered to people in our group, we couldn\u2019t fly together. Qantas has become a poverty airline, food on plane looked like dog food, no pillows, no blankets, no entertainment packs for kids, unhappy, rude staff. No longer my airline of preference, I strongly suggest to those planning a holiday to take a road trip and avoid flying. No more qantas for me.","593":"Cancelled flight travelled 3hrs never told. Oh your flight is rescheduled for tomorrow. First flight was booked to India QF69 go figure. Heading the same as Ansett","594":"Hottest day of the year. Flight cancelled due to the heat (but every other airline managed to take off!). Flight only cancelled after we had been on-board for 4 hours. Given really bad accommodation for the night and a bus voucher to get us there. No updates provided as to when the rescheduled flight was leaving. All updates were either inaccurate, or too late as were already boarded the next day. Details on the App were inaccurate and emails non-existent for some. No direction from any ground staff or support provided. Travellers left to work it all out for themselves. Not offered the next available flight but one 40 hours later and into the bargain - downgraded with no notification or option to upgrade. No refunds given or any explanation on how to obtain refunds. When asked if we could have a Fastpass for the security given that we had stood in the queue twice already for over 4hrs - \"we only give those out to Business and First Class customers\".\nComplete lack of customer care and a disgrace as a National Airline.","595":"Wow!! The staff at Quantas have no souls, they are evil people who enjoy not letting people visit their families after what has gone down the last 2 years. It's a very long story but the crux of it is, they wouldn't accept my exemption or doctors letter at the airport. They made me jump through hoops. At the exact minute my flight was departing, the manager called me to the desk. I thought they were letting me through, that they had some emotion. Nope, they gave me an incorrect email address to lodge my exemption through. She could barely hold onto the smirk she had.","596":"Terrible experience by Qantas,\nDespite showing Queensland vaccine cert to Andrew (qantas officer), 1st thing he said I won\u2019t allow you to board in as this is not the \u201cvaccine certificate\u201d,\nWe told him we travelled few times, even international flights and it was allright using that queensland vaccination cert, then he said \u201coh allright then\u201d\n\n2nd issue: our baggages should be auto checked in for our next international flight, but this fella insist and told us we have to collect and re check in at brisbane airport (despite time frame 1 hour 40 minutes)\nI asked him to clarify with Malaysia airline as according to MAS, our baggages should be auto checked in for the next flight, our parents travelled with qantas last week and no issue with their baggages (auto check in)\n\nAndrew claimed MAS BLOCKED US from checking in our things, i called MAS myself, and put it on the loudspeaker, MAS officer said on their system it was green meaning no issue with the baggages being auto transfer. Andrew refused any eye contacts and was rushing checking in our baggages (to get rid of us quickly)\n\nTold MAS that andrew refused to check in, MAS OFFICER wanted to speak to andrew, but andrew refused, no other Qantas supervisor come and try to explain to us. I had to raise my voice as Andrew was totally not interacting with us, 1 min later he said everything is solved.\n\nImo, andrew is racist and shame on qantas airline for having this type of officer in your team.","597":"The worst 7 hours ever airbus A300\/300 not near comfortable very tight 2 seat on the side only good for kids seats are hard no screen works they said system just broke down meals are terrible staff looks not happy even light in the airbus not cheerful I was about leave the airplane as I got scared from what I saw look like very old style airplane that come from 1970s never ever I use it again pilot was very skilled thanks to god","598":"what an airline. if anything goes wrong, forget the help. 5 hours then they hang up. complete joke. singapore airlines help was ONE MINUTE. British airways 30 minutes. NEVER EVER USE QANTAS. if the auto booking crashes, forget help.","599":"Another cancelled flight and stuck in the terminal for another 6 hours. I identified an earlier flight and accepted the seat allocation in economy and was refused a refund from the down grade from Business Class. The aircraft was filthy and it was quite obvious that it had not been cleaned with rubbish on he floor, seats and in the seat pockets. There is no entertainment system and the customer service was atrocious. The food has also lowered to a new level with the delivery of a soggy egg and avocado sandwich.","600":"After 40 hours travelling back from Colombia, Qantas's flight that was scheduled to depart at 12:00 hours, departed at 18:00 hours. No-one offered even a single glass of water. After hours of waiting, physically and mentally exhausted, I complained again, I was given a voucher worth $15 to have something to eat. I cordially invite Qantas' CEO to have a meal at the airport for that amount of money. I tried to upgrade using my Frequent Flyer Points : waste of time and money","601":"The ever decreasing QANTAS standards cannot get much lower with another late departure combined with a dirty aircraft (food crumbs on my seat with rubbish stashed in the back of the seat). The entertainment system is non existent whilst the food was barely edible; I wish there was a suitable domestic carriage competitor in Australia.","602":"Website useless....couldn't book seats, so had to call customer service several times. Finally got through after being on hold for 2 hours\n\nNo beer or spirits offered on flight going out. Only shiraz and chardonnay.\n\nFood going out was slop in a cardboard box.\n\nComing back to NZ was even worse:\n\nWe were left waiting at least 45 minutes after take off before being offered any liquid refreshments, they also announced over the speaker that the cutlery had not been packed and they would not be able to provide food service. However, they would be able to offer tea,coffee,juice,water and a small snack. We could see they had other soft drinks in the trolley eg coke, lemonade etc but they were not offering it. No alcohol offered at all?\n\nThe in flight entertainment was very limited.\n\nThey seriously need to look at their Customer Service and take a leaf out of Emirates book, who we flew with from UK to Dubai and Dubai to Melbourne and had excellent service. Melbourne to NZ was with Qantas.\n\nI would never book Qantas again nor recommend them.","603":"Flew on Qantas 737 today 1 hour 30 min flight. The flight attendant distributed sandwiches and a cold drink. I asked for coffee but this was not on offer. I asked for the cabin service manager and then got coffee. I was told they do coffe on this route in the morning but not in the afternoon! I have had the no coffe problem twice before. The first time I just sucked it up at the time but lodged an online complaint with Qantas - no response. The next time I asked for the cabin service supervisor, and did get coffee. I think coffee is a non-controversial request and I should not be having this unreasonable difficulty","604":"Qantas no longer embodies the meaning of the \u201cspirit of Australia.\u201d This branding should be removed and Alan Joyce sacked as the customer service is shocking. I flew over one week ago and am still waiting on 2 pieces of luggage. This has been a complete cluster with communication between Qantas and United sorely lacking. Qantas will not accept calls to baggage service with all queries being directed to the website which indicates they are still trying to locate these bags. United confirmed they were transferred to a QF flight; hence, they must be in Australia. I have lost all faith in Qantas to sift through their mountain of luggage and to deliver these items in a timely fashion. To that end, waiting over a week on much needed items with no compensation or recourse from Qantas is unacceptable.","605":"Customer service is appalling. Qantas changed the flights that I had booked due to my first Qantas leg being delayed, gave me connections that were impossible to make, which I pointed out to Qantas ground staff who told me to approach Qantas staff in Singapore if I missed my connection and they would sort it out. I missed my connection, approached Qantas staff at Singapore who informed me that they are just contractors and I would need to call their help line (my phone wouldn't work in Singapore,) when I did explain to the person on the help line what had happened they said it was up to me to make sure I had time to make my connection (My original flights gave me ample time, the reroute Qantas put me on did not.) So I was stranded in Singapore and had to purchase another flight with another carrier at great expense. I will NEVER fly Qantas again.","606":"This flight was cancelled which I was not notified about until i did my online check in, If i had not checked in prior to arriving at the airport I and my disabled daughter would have been in real trouble. After the flight was cancelled Qantas staff could not refund or give me a credit because the flight is through a subsidiary of qantas, Sunstate airlines. Sunstate airlines have no phone number or customer service contact point at all. I am and have been before completely stuck and unable to change my qantas ticket, with no response from qantas\/Sunstate. once they sell the ticket thats it, they are not in any way interested after that. You either get on the plane and make your flight or you miss out. I will not be missing out again, I will be going to the fair trade ombudsman, they are legally obliged to offer customer service on their products and so far we have none except a computer that does not allow for changes or communications with sunstate bookings made through qantas.","607":"Have been chasing up on a seat charge that should have been refunded after I upgraded to business class. 4 x phone calls diverted to South African call room and 1 x phone complaint plus an email - Absolutely no action - HOPELESS !","608":"Hello! My name is JK from Christchurch, New Zealand. My tickets were all booked through Qantas Airlines. I had a flight from Christchurch to Sydney on June 9th takeoff 0600 and landing 0745, then Sydney to Los Angeles takeoff 1015 and landing 0700 on June 9th, then lastly Los Angeles to New York takeoff 0900 and landing 1747. Around 2115 on June 8th, I received a text message from Qantas that they had to change my flight\/flight would be delayed for Sydney to LA (QF11) and an update will be available in 30 minutes. I waited but there was none. They knew that I had a connecting flight (QF3107) from LA to New York, which I would miss if I were to go through the delayed flight. I had to call Qantas Contact Support hours before my flight to find me flights that I would of course not miss. It was an almost 4-hour call and I thought the agent was so patient that she sorted everything out. Initially it was QF11 Sydney to LA take off 1015 on June 9th, but was changed to FJ910 Sydney to Nadi take off 1315 on June 9th as flight QF11 was already non-existent. It was an unforgettable experience for me because my birthday was coming up in June 11th and I did not want to celebrate it at the airport alone. I was really stressed out and tearful. I felt a little relieved that one of the airport managers in Syndey was so kind to assist and reassure me that everything will be arranged. But even then everything was not really fixed. The airline could have at least offered a flight upgrade.\n\nI was able to catch FJ910 and made it all the way to JFK Airport in New York City. Upon arriving I was informed by my last carrier Delta Airlines DL436 that my checked baggage was not with them. \n\nI filled out a Delayed Baggage Form with Delta Airlines.\n\nAfter multiple follow-ups from Qantas, Delta, and Fiji Airways, I was able to finally receive my luggage on June 20th. The exterior of my luggage had scratches. It was such a hassle and a traumatic experience, not having my checked luggage for 11 days, since I had to buy new stuff even though they were in my luggage. I also had 3 luxury bags inside which added to my anxiety about my luggage.\n\nFrom rebooking my flights twice to the delays of my checked baggage, Qantas had made several egregious mistakes that was very difficult for me. The airline may have reasons, but it was very hard because some days there were no communication or clear answers. I have not received cash support like other airlines do or anything in acknowledgment of the hassle and bad experience.\n\nI believe I deserve a fair compensation for all of these. I hope this would never happen again on your future flights\u2026\n\nUnfortunately, it did happen again. Upon coming back to New Zealand on July 10th, my checked baggage was again missing. I did all the necessary steps at the airport before leaving. In the end, I received my luggage after 3 days, on July 13th.\n\nWhat a horrible experience! I have documentation of my experiences, a sad reminder of what I went through. I hope Qantas reaches out and try to win back a customer.","609":"Qantas have commoditised their flights now. They used to offer more but now you might as well just book domestic flights within Australia based on price and schedule. Qantas don't offer anything special. They got us there - flight left Sydney late with no explanation until we were in the air - some excuse about having a lot of bags to load? This is an airline - shouldn't you have learned about to do that since you started in 1920... The in flight \"snack\" was the same awful salsa stuff from our precious flight. I enjoyed the movie I watched on the app but make sure you bring your own device. I'm gold so had priority luggage which came off after most of the regular tagged bags had. So thanks for getting us home but all very average.","610":"Endless wait times on phone calls, double charging on seat selection via the website, agents that can't answer the most basic questions about your booking...Qantas is an absolute nightmare and I haven't even taken the flight yet. Website is a train wreck forcing people to attempt to call them. Hours long waits are the norm.\nQantas went from one of the best airlines in the world to one of the worst. In short order. I will never fly them again. I fly 100k miles a year and have never had a more miserable experience just buying a plane ticket.","611":"Luggage lost on the way. We were about to go on a live aboard diving boat, so had to spend a lot of money on things we needed. Bags arrived after our diving trip, so had them for our sightseeing few days. Bags have now been lost again on the return trip. Hoping they will turn up today before next flight out of the country this evening. Vegetarian food order did not go through with booking as well.","612":"Lost luggage, not able to contact someone as they are too busy for days on end, calls keep getting disconnected... going on 5 days now, No international call number so good luck calling from overseas.\n\nOnly putting in this review to warn people don't take luggage with Qantas unless you want your stuff lost and to have to chase them for compensation or involve your travel insurance.\n\nThe board needs to sack Alan Joyce and get someone who can actually run a company before quatas our national carrier is completed ruined like ansett","613":"Qantas have their own domestic terminal at Sydney, separate to all the other airlines. I accidentally went to the wrong terminal, and through security, the whole deal - which of course made me late for my flight (hazards of online check-in is that you may not notice this when running from the train\/taxi).\nI eventually found my way to the gate as the plane taxied away...\nQantas staff were very empathetic and put me straight on the next flight at the gate next door which was currently boarding. No fuss, and all smiles.\nBreakfast on the plane was great, and all staff were so polite and friendly.\nOnboard free wifi functioned properly and again, fuss free.\nGreat result from what could have been an awful (and expensive) trip.","614":"Flew business class Melbourne to Singapore last Saturday and get the \u201cwe are sorry to inform you the inflight entertainment will not be working on your flight\u201d text a few hours before. This is a common theme with friends and family receiving the same on the same routes.\n\nWhat a joke, you charge a FULL fare but zero entertainment, wifi or substitution on an 8 hour international flight.\n\nLast time I fly with you.","615":"Flights to Auckland delayed, lost connection to next flight. Gave us a hotel but paid only $ 30 for lunch each person. No vouchers for dinner. No taxi voucher to hotel.\nArrived to Auckland, our suitcases were lost. Arrived a week after. Snow boots were there, so we missed our snow trip\u2026\nOn the way back flight was delayed 2 and 1\/2 hours. Last seat on the plane. No food choices for my son that is allergic.\nFood was terrible. Entertainment system only 15 movies available. Old plane. I really recommend another airline until Qantas improves to its standard.","616":"Completely eaten my money. Split my \u2018refund\u2019 into two completely unusable flight credit vouchers. I\u2019m at Uni next year, I don\u2019t have any time to come back to australia. One voucher I can only redeem by calling them? Why would that ever be a thing their customer service over the phone is already slow enough. One voucher seemingly doesn\u2019t work for any flights? If you want any respect for this company give up. Complete money scam.","617":"Since the pandemic Qantas has proved itself to be a second rate airline. We now avoid when possible. First the 4-6 hour waits on the phone to redeem credits- ours was such that there were no online options to do this. This was a 3 month long process.\n\nFlight from Sydney to Honolulu was in an old aircraft with no entertainment and was scruffy and rundown- it felt like the 90s. Encountered some turbulence- not much but the seat belt signal went on. Although three children just in our area were sick and filled up bags and a guy next to us had an epileptic fit , there was no way to get an attendant to come help . All calls were ignored. One man stood up to help his vomiting child and a voice come over the loud speaker asking him to sit down. It seems the safety of staff is more important than the passengers. The passengers ended up helping each other.\n\nThen on the way home Qantas cancelled a flight and rebooked us. For some reason the ground staff weren\u2019t notified of the changes so another 45 min delay on the phone. Hard to understand how that happens with computer systems.\n\nWe had 5 internal USA flights on our holiday- none had the issues Qantas has. It is an embarrassment as a National carrier.","618":"What a disappointment from Qantas. Their Business Class service was a joke, it cost a fortune and was more like Premium Economy with a bed provided. The toilet at the front of the plane was not cleaned during the whole flight and was very dirty by half way through. Once the plane took off I was offered a drink and requested some nuts to go with the drink. I received a small plate with 8 almonds and asked if they had any mixed nuts but was told that is all they serve. The same glass was used for my dinner wine and just topped up. When I woke up that glass was still sitting there on my side table as breakfast was being served. My breakfast never arrived because they had forgotten to pick up my order form the night before. There was not much time before landing and the steward was apologetic but I was limited to my choice of coffee and croissant. When I went to the galley to ask for a bottle of water I was asked to bring my empty bottle back to them and they would fill it. They don\u2019t replace the bottles. How nice it would of been if they could of offered to get the bottle for me and refill it. Their amenities bag contents have shrunk to midget size and I wonder if the PJ\u2019s will be the next to go. Instead of giving the boss a huge pay rise I think the time has come for Qantas to start taking better care of their passengers who are now paying big dollars to fly in style. There are plenty of other airlines out there who are One World members and offer a far superior Business Class to what Qantas is now offering.","619":"HORRIBLE They gave away my seat and dumped me on another airline My 15 hour flight turned from a one stop flight into a 4 stop flight and over 40 hours. I was a mess\nI showed up on time and paid for my ticket.","620":"seat 6a -a disaster sooo uncomfortable like a plank of wood\ncannot get any where comfortqble so the need to get much better\npadding!!!","621":"I have been flying Qantas for years and have never seen such a poor baggage handling at Sydney airport. It took more than an hour for priority tagged baggage to arrive. I have been very proud supporter of Qantas but something needs to be done for baggage handling.","622":"Flying is now back to being a chore. We enjoyed the quiet COVID airports and planes over last 2 years... but we are now back to normal... this 717 was almost full. The drinks were better with a range served but the snack was horrible runny salsa with crackers. The business tagged bags came off towards the middle - no priority given. They got us there. The entertainment app was working. Nothing bad, nothing special.","623":"The baggage challenges of airlines across the world are discussed widely and COVID is to blame. The Qantas CEO blames the travelling public for not being match fit and accepts no responsibility for outsourcing the baggage handlers. Our flight arrived on time and the we waited and waited and waited for our bags. Yes I was happy the bag arrived as many don't but 45 minutes wait for my bag is not good enough.","624":"Qantas really needs immense improvement. Received sms on Flight delayed for 12 hours before our trip to sydney and when we tried changing the flight to earlier timing, we saw that the flight with the original timing still exists! puzzled, we called qantas for hours but seems like a non existed line, could never get thru. Frantically, we call Changi Airport service line (nothing related to Qantas) to confirm on the delay, the staff just settled our query in 5mins and confirm there was a delay. For this we changed our itinerary and lost some service fee in between.\n\nOn our return trip to Singapore, 1 baggage lost. that was when we frantically called Qantas but no one answered so we gave up and went to Changi Airport lost and found counter, made a report there but after 4days today, its still not found.. We tried to be understanding but Qantas is beyond hope if they continue in this manner as what most had reviewed.","625":"The crew were lovely, service first rate.\nLeft on time and bags turned up. Bonus.\nI thought though that the plane was a bit tired. Seat a bit scuffed and while not dirty could have done with a wipe down.\nIn flight system is hard to navigate and the flight map is 10 years at least behind competitors","626":"I called the 131313 number and my call was answered by a woman who clearly didn't want to be on the phone.\n\nShe huffed and puffed, screamed at her children 'give that back to her', 'stop that'. Her kids were fighting in the background. She tried to hang up on me several times and told me none of the flights I needed were available after a 1 second pause each time I said try a different day. I cancelled my ticket and lost money on seat allocation I had paid for. I then went back to look and the flights I needed were available. She didn't want to look for flights. She was desperate to get back to her personal business. Why even have a call centre like this? She may have even been running around the house she was breathing so deeply. Im not sure she even had the computer in front of her when she supposedly checked my flight. This was around 6pm at night. Just terrible service.","627":"Qantas changed our flights from London to Perth putting us on flights with a 36 hour transit which in Hong Kong is not allowed . Over 24 hours we will have to go into quarantine for 7 days! Qantas see no problem with this. The 131313 staff are difficult to understand ( hearing aids) and do not understand my Australian accent ? where they are based","628":"We booked our flights in February to travel to and around Europe in Aug\/Sept, on a 6-week trip to finally see family. None of our flights were with Qantas but we booked using frequent flyer points, so had to go through Qantas as online booking would not work. In May Qantas 'accidentally' cancelled all our tickets - not the flights - and we spent a week trying to get them to reinstate our bookings, This finally happened and we have spent days organising and booking accommodation, hire cars, restaurants, trains, ferries etc in 5 different European countries.\n\nQantas have again cancelled our tickets with no reason or accountability, and we have no comeback. Contact with them involves hours waiting for a call to be answered before being hung up on, with no calls ever returned and no-one taking responsibility. I understand this is a deliberate approach by Qantas as it has happened to so many others, and I can only assume that cancelling our tickets is also deliberate as we have used little cash to make our bookings and are therefore of little consequence. And we now have to spend more time cancelling all our accommodation and other reservations. The distress and uncertainty caused, not to mention the waste of time and money is unconscionable.","629":"DO NOT FLY WITH QANTAS\n\nQantas issued me a 'flight credit' as a refund for a flight I had to cancel (I paid extra to book a ticket that permitted a refund). In theory, I am meant to be able to use this flight credit (approx $400) to purchase another Qantas flight (12 month expiry). However, they have made it literally impossible for me to actually use the flight credit. On 6 separate occasions, I have called the designated phone line and spent in total over 17 hours on hold. Each and every time I've reached someone they have said one of the following:\n1) We can't process this now please call back later\n2) I need to liaise with another department please call back later\n3) There are no flights available (even though I provide them with an exact flight number for a flight that has seats available to be booked on their website).\n4) Twice they have simply hung up after waiting for over 4 hours on hold each time\n5) On my final effort, I called and they said I had a $400 flight credit. They then said I couldn't book the flight I wanted and hung up. I called back and got onto another person. They said they checked my account and I had no flight credits and that they went back to the original booking and the terms and conditions did not permit a refund. They refused any further discussion and hung up.\nClearly, they are not only making it impossible to use the flight credit, but also resorting to deception and flat-out denying that I have a flight credit. They are effectively holding my money for ransom and are not providing the service.\n\nIt is worth noting Qantas that \"Consumer advocacy organisation Choice has filed a formal complaint with the ACCC after consumer surveys highlighted the \u201cmany obstacles\u201d faced by Qantas customers seeking to cash in their flight credits.\"","630":"this is going to be my last trip using Qantas airways nooooo anymore.\ndelayed \u2705\ncancelled \u2705\nrebooked\u2705\nchaos\u2705\nrude\u2705","631":"Only negative we had to wait with no food for 9 hours in transit area until Qantas rep arrived to print our boarding passes - we had been told the wait would only be 3 hours","632":"How can such a good airline, for so many years, turn to crap so quickly?\nWedged in like sardines in those horrible winglets. Flight delayed but still managed to lose my luggage for 3 days outbound and 2 days on the return trip.\nNo iPad or media screens on a 4.5 hour flight.\nThank heavens I didn\u2019t cop the back row aisle seats and spend the flight with various persons crotches or backsides in my face as they jockeyed to get around each other to access the 2 toilets. (Original plane design was for 3 but someone that flies business class removed 1 to fit extra seating in).","633":"I don\u2019t usually write a review but feel compelled to do so after such a terrible treatment from Qantas.\n\nBooked 5 tickets for a family holiday to Tasmania.\nOn our last day in Hobart, our flight home from Hobart to Melbourne was cancelled 12 hours before departure. We were automatically booked onto the same flight THE Next Day without any discussion or explanation. I called Qantas customer service who basically offered us no other options. No apology. No empathy. Told us that we should just deal with it as it was in their terms and conditions when we bought the tickets.\n\nWhen we asked about refund, she told us it would take 68 WEEKS for it to be processed! We got quite upset, she then put us on hold then HANG UP. We called again, again we were put on hold, then hang up. This seems to be their strategy.\n\nAfter calling around to make arrangement for our work, we accepted that we would have to stay another day in Hobart. Then I noticed we have no upcoming trip booked on Qantas app. We rushed to Hobart, was served by Qantas staff at the counter (Ting) who was equally rude. Basically could not care less about what happened to us. Again no apology. No sympathy. All she wanted to know was if I would accept the first flight she rescheduled for us.\n\nI am beyond appalled by the way Qantas treated their customers! Never in my life have I felt so embarrassed to be a Qantas frequent flyer. I fly regularly for work and to see family overseas. NEVER AGAIN with QANTAS!!","634":"Once again, QF have not delivered our bag\u2026 although this time it was both of our bags\u2026. We booked a connecting flight from Cairns via Sydney to Manila departing on the 7th July\u2026 we are now in Boracay\u2026 it is the 12th tomorrow\u2026 no luggage\u2026 no ETA!!! We have had to spend hundreds of dollars on some clothes, medication, visits to medical centre ..\n\nThis is the second time that Qantas has lost our bags\u2026. We\u2019ll never again will we fly Qantas\u2026. There is no recourse to follow up with them\u2026 they do not care\u2026 no complaints call line\u2026 no lost baggage call line\u2026 they don\u2019t offer any compensation any more if you show up to airport and bags haven\u2019t arrived\u2026. So over them\u2026.","635":"Please, please never use Qantas through Gotogate. It is the most terrible service you could receive. I have been waiting for over 12 months for them to get back to me. I have numerous letters to head office with no reply. I have lost count how many times I have called and no answer. And I have certainly lost on the emails that have been sent and still not heard back. Terrible customer service.","636":"First family holiday with our baby, went with Qantus thinking it would make life easier. What a mistake!!!\nFlight was delayed and then cancelled at midnight before we even left. Connecting flights then delayed and had to almost run between flights (with a baby!).\nHad to change return flight due to getting covid and was changed an extra $1200! Website was down and was changed per operator we spoke to on phone.\nThen on the return home first flight was cancelled only hours before hand. They had no options to change our flights without us having to stay at airports over night. So we cancelled our flights had to drive 3.5hrs to Brisbane next day to catch a Virgin flight instead.\nNot to mention other family members had all the same issues (was a big family get together holiday), flights delayed considerably so Connecting flights not possible and\/or cancelled, phone operator fees, added sneeky expenses, terrible customer support.\nWill not be flying with Qantus again. Virgin was so much better, more reliable and Heaps cheaper.","637":"Qantas doesn't care about customers. After a long flight from Dallas to Sydney, got to know Qantas cancelled my flight to Melbourne. Rebooked my family in a flight which involved a wait time of 11+ hours. No matter how much I pleaded, Qantas staff refused to provide any kind of support to make us comfortable. Worst customer service ever!","638":"I had the rudest flight attendant I think I\u2019ve ever met. My sister and I were in economy while my parents were in business and I was busting for the toilet. I went up to go and talk to my parents as there was no barriers and IM A MINOR, and I got yelled at by a male flight attendant for being in the wrong \u201cclass\u201d and I didn\u2019t get his name. I went to use the bathrooms positioned right next to my parents as I was busting and the path to the economy bathrooms was blocked by vomit and people cleaning it and I once again got treated like a peasent. I said I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m busting and both my parents are in business class and he said \u201cbad luck there\u2019s nothing we can do\u201d. For the remainder of the flight, I felt dehydrated but was not confortable asking for water and when he came around with food I was afraid to say yes to having some. I get that people have bad days but being this rude to a kid who isn\u2019t with their parents and now found out she has bali belly, IS NOT OK.","639":"I have tried to get feedback from QANTAS with regards to my experience on QF0063 on June 21st. I have flown with QANTAS on many occasions and have always had nothing but good things to say BUT this last flight was an absolute shocker.\n\nNot only was the food disgusting but the whole business class smelled of fishy fish from the \u201cThai fish cakes\u201d that were obviously heated up in the galley. The lamb that followed was served on soggy bread and was a messy pile of lamb. I personally found neither dish edible and was actually physically sick by only tasting the lamb dish, I spat out the first bite of the fish cake it was so foul tasting. My experience was such that I was left with no appetite for anything served on the rest of the flight.\n\nThere was one small bottle of water at my seat (5K) when I sat down when I asked for another bottle I was told they didn\u2019t have but could top up my bottle - in my view this is not acceptable and unhygienic.\n\nThe biggest issue for me was that as a FULL paying business class customer they did not even have a pillow for me!! I was actually flabbergasted when they offered me a sleep mattress as a substitute - NO PILLOW?? No apology, no pillow \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI waited several days for a response from customer complainants and when it came it was a sorry the food wasn\u2019t to my liking - nothing about the lack of water NOR the fact that they didn\u2019t have a pillow for me. Absolutely disgraceful.\n\nI am a pensioner and saved up to have a comfortable hassle free flight unfortunately this was anything but.\n\nI also had to queue for over TWO hours to get through security!!\n\nI SAVED UP FOR TWO YEARS TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE R61,000-00 TICKET BUT I MAY AS WELL HAVE BEEN IN ECONOMY CLASS. IM ABSOLUTELY GUTTED AND FEEL THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.\n\nA VERY UNHAPPY SENIOR CITIZEN!!","640":"Notwithstanding I'm a Qantas Frequent Flyer (was!), arrived at the airport early, used a QTag on the baggage, my bag was not put onto the plane. I lodged a claim in Brisbane at the Baggage Services desk (something contradictory about that \"services\" bit). The poor gentleman was clearly tired from dealing with frustrated clients and indicated he was so embarrassed to be a Qantas employee he no longer wears his shirt in public. He provided me a reference number and said they sent me a SMS message advising me of the fact the bag was not loaded onto the plane. I quickly checked and confirmed to him that no SMS message was received. This was Day 1. Day 2, no advice, contact Qantas and advised there were \"lengthy delays\" if I wanted to wait - or track online - I chose the later to establish my bag was scheduled to arrive that evening into Brisbane - not morning but evening!!! Checked online that evening - no status change to the bag. Day 3, bag still not arrived, although the status said that they know where it is... still can't get a call through the Baggage Services..... got through to someone in the Qantas Frequent Flyer program... they couldn't tell me anything.... what a debacle!","641":"Qantas made mistakes when booking the ticket, literally no way to rectify as helpline just hangs up.\n\nEvery single call, even those made by Qantas team in the lounge listened to the problem, put on hold and then hung up.\n\nOnce flown (which is obviously to most people a necessity), am told rectifying the booking charge even harder.\n\nI feel sorry for the Qantas team on the ground who are well aware of the problem and say that is now the strategy from management. Truly amazing. If only there was another airline with same coverage in Aus. Monopoly power at its worse","642":"Trying to buy extra baggage allowance as well as manage seat.

Ask what time departure is as I had not eaten, drank anything or been to bathroom since arriving at check in at 5.30am. Told \u201cit will leave when everyone is on board, go to the gate\u201d. This was the first time I spoke to a Qantas staff member. There was no information provided the entire 4 and a 1\/2 hours of waiting in the check in line.\n\nHead to immigration, boarding pass doesn\u2019t scan as it is for the flight on Friday at 9.05pm.

Original flight was meant to land Sunday 3 July at 6am.\n\nUtter disgrace. I will never fly Qantas again. Complete lack of any form of communication. Any communication received was incorrect. No apologies or compensation offered.","644":"Qantas Hotels cancelled my hotel booking in Broome the day before I arrived. Had to rebook the hotel myself at a vastly inflated price. The only explanation given by Qantas hotels is that they no longer had my credit card details on file (they say they no longer keep credit card details) and they were unable to contact me. They refused my request for compensation. Have they done this with others ?","645":"Worst customer service I have ever received in my whole life. I have never been compelled to write a review for any company - but I highly suggest not booking through Qantas holidays. Flight centre is not only cheaper, but much more flexible and friendly. The way the staff spoke to me was disgusting, and one they\u2019ve taken your money they literally could not care less about you.","646":"No halal meals available 2 times I flight with them option 1 was egg and pork option 2 potato and bacon second time the only halal option was yoghurt","647":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. COVID caused chaos with travel and I understand airlines are doing it tough but I've read so many stories similar in nature to mine about the horrible treatment of customers by Qantas.\n\nI have children in NZ and prior to COVID had regularly flown back and forth, mostly with Jetstar to keep the cost down.\nOnce travel recommenced Jetstar was not available and so we booked with Qantas who I have been a frequent flyer member with for years.\n\nWhen booking one of my flights online I forgot to add all passengers. Waited 2.5 hrs to talk to someone on the phone and was told I could add the children left off the original booking simply by creating another booking for them.\nAfter the phone call I tried to create another booking and of course you cannot create a booking for young children alone and there's no option to add them to your booking once completed.\nSpent another 2 hours on hold before call dropped. Created another booking for everyone and did online request for credit for 1st booking. I made a number of attempts to have the first booking turned into a refund by attending the Qantas desk at Sydney international, sending multiple emails to the Qantas frequent flyer customer service address, and calling a number of times over the following weeks.\nI also had another flight credit for a change in flight plans weeks later and had waited a number of weeks for this credit to appear.\nI make a call regarding this credit and I am told Qantas has declined the credit request. Without any communication they pocketed the funds and had not sent any notice about their decision. After listening to me complain the Qantas employee on the phone advised the credit would be authorised and put back onto the card I used for payment. Over a month now and not seen the credit.\nI make a call very recently to find out about this credit and I am told it is there however it won't show online as it can only be used by booking over the phone.... Minimum 60 minutes wait for phone calls to Qantas from my experience. There was no communication prior to tell me this credit was available and it appeared online as still being processed.\n\nDetails for using credit online state you can book Jetstar flights by calling only.\nI find Jetstar flights that suit online and try to book these flights during a phone call to Qantas. They are unable to book my preferred flight as it doesn't show on their system. The only Jetstar flights for around the dates I was looking at that were available to me according to Qantas were flights that were at least double my preferred option. To use my credit I would be out of pocket more than if I were to create a new booking directly with Jetstar.\nI say to the Qantas employee, \"So Qantas will only let me use my credit on really expensive Jetstar flights?\" Employee says that is correct....\n\nI have had to make all efforts to contact Qantas as they have not attempted to contact me at all, except for generic replies to some emails of course.\n\nI would not recommend Qantas to anyone. They have completely transformed themselves into the worst airline I've ever used and I seriously doubt any other airlines could take their place, ever.","648":"DON\u2019T FLY WITH QANTAS!\nTHEY DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT PASSENGERS!\nAfter travelling for 4 days, with 50 hours delay, the luggage lost\u2026 No clothes, no important papers, no nothing...\nNo answers, no client service, no information, no clue of where my professional material can be\u2026\nTERRIBLE SERVICE!\nNEVER EVER USING QANTAS AGAIN!!\nMORE THAN A WEEK IN THIS MESS!!! And Qantas doesn't care...","649":"Flew a number of different flights (domestic) on different aircrafts in the last month.\nA330, airbus 320, Fokker 100, and A380.\nIt is no secret that Qantas has been having some difficulties recently.\nOn the ground I didn\u2019t see this. Maybe they are like ducks at the moment. Calm on the surface but lots of paddling happening beneath the surface.\nYes there were long lines at the airport - easily dealt with by arriving early and using complimentary lounge invites.\nYes - one of my flight was delayed. What\u2019s new! This happened before covid.\nTheir staff are working extremely hard in difficult times.\nTheir staff were helpful with check in, there to answer questions, patient and professional on board the flights.\nThe planes were clean and covid protocols adhered to.\nBags turned up when and where they should have. Air tags gave piece of mind as well as carrying a spare change of clothing - I did this before covid. Travel is restarting. Be kind.","650":"I bought two tickets from Mount Gambier to Melbourne at 16\/12\/2021, Qantas change 3 times about fly date and time. After i ask to refund the tickets. However, I didn't receive the refund. I wrote few times email and call the 131131, still no result. It is over 6 months. I called 131131, waiting over 30min, staff said, he will call back.","651":"I missed my connecting flight due to amount of time it took for baggage to arrive and long wait for a terminal transfer bus. The first Qantas person I spoke to about rebooking my missed flight was rude and unhelpful. I then joined a very long slow moving line to rebook. There were a lot of very confused customers. Occasionally a supervisor would appear from a door then quickly disappear again. It looked like they were actively avoiding customers. After 20 minutes the 2 staff members behind the desk just got up and left with no explanation. They came back after 20 minutes having left the queue unattended. Eventually some more people arrived to help. I felt sorry for the new helpers as they were all new and didn\u2019t know how to work any of the systems. It appears that customer services is very low on Qantas priorities. Nobody apologised to me at any point for any inconvenience caused. General attitude of more experienced staff seemed to be one of indifference to customers at best, and viewing customers as an annoying inconvenience at worst.","652":"Another thrice delayed flight from QANTAS on an aircraft with no entertainment system. The flight was cancelled with all passengers being transferred to another flight 2 hours later; this flight was then delayed for a further 60 minutes. The fight was further delayed as the aircrew had failed to show up on time. In flight entertainment was not existent but on the bright side, the meal was delicious. The aircraft was not clean as we found used tissues in the seat pocket.","653":"I flew in business class from LON to SYD on 20 June. On 19 June, we boarded the plane. We were told that there was congestion at Heathrow - we waited on the plane for 45 mins. After this the pilot advised that there was an engine fault. Again a 1.5hr delay. After this we were told that the crew had run out of hours and could not fly us to Darwin. We waited in line for 1.5 hours after finding one Qantas agent . We were sent to a 2 star hotel 45 min from the airport at 3am. No meals were available at the hotel. No meals were offered by Qantas. I incurred over $100 in taxi claims and have submitted this for reimbursement - there has been no response from Qantas despite now four submissions through their website and three phone calls which are routed overseas where the staff do not demonstrate either empathy or an understanding of processes. Surely you should be able to speak to someone in Australia rather than an overseas agent!\n\nI am disappointed that this was the service provided for a ticket that costs $16,000 for a roundtrip to London","654":"never experienced ever in my life in airlines.\nThey made me call 3 times approx 4 hours just for correcting a name for my flight. (I made a one letter typo). Each staff gave me different solution.\nand now i ended up cancelling my flight and STILL waiting for them to accept my request.\nThe only reason why I still have to wait for them is there is no flights available in other airlines because it is the xmas week. because of this i might miss my nephews wedding.\nridiculous. I just need to fix one letter.","655":"Absolutely appalling. Flights cancelled multiple times cause me to miss a funeral. Staff were kind but unable to assist. This is Qantas caring more about money than their customers. I have flown with them 4 times this year (there is no other service in my area that could fly me during this time) and each flight had been cancelled or delayed. Qantas need to address this immediately, it is totally unacceptable. I have never had this much trouble with another airline at any point in time.","656":"I found vomit in my seat pocket after I had already placed my belongings inside. Staff were extremely unhelpful and actually pretty rude. They offered me wet wipes so I could clean up the mess... And actually moved me to a worse seat than the vomit seat I had chosen weeks earlier (at a cost).\n\nI sent a note to customer service about the experience. Customer service took months to respond to my complaint and their eventual response was \"better luck next time you travel with us.\" It's honestly covid times, they make us all wear masks, but there's literal vomit in a seat pocket?\n\nWould never fly again. Much prefer airlines that are actually clean and polite like Singapore Airlines.","657":"The flight departed late resulting in a late arrival; no significant impact but reflects the apparent downward spiral of this airline. In service was satisfactory but the food was terrible with boiled bacon and undercooked eggs. Although a reasonable new aircraft, I was surprised to see that my table tray was held together by good old gaffer tape - in business class! Flight staff were empathetic but were unable to resolve the problem.","658":"This flight was about staff who just do enough and have a matter of fact attitude to passengers . There ere few smiles or efforts to engage or please. Flights like this with QANTAS remind why we fly with Thai or Singapore or QATAR airlines where service is kind and attentive and happy . Maybe QANTAS should care a bit more about the average economy passenger and not be so about first class and business class in their image and marketing .","659":"Wish I could leave less than zero. Pathetic service from a pathetic company. Go elsewhere if you can.","660":"Daughter and family booked to go to Bribane, direct. After two cancelled flights and four delayed flights, finally got to go via Sydney with a five hour stop over.\nTotally unacceptable. No explanations, no apologies, no compensation.","661":"After 10 years of flying with the Middle Eastern Airlines (emirates etc) I thought I would try Qantas from London to Perth with a 14 hour non stop 1st leg to Singapore.\n\nIt was below par, very limited leg room, terrible food, average flight attendant service and the in flight entertainment was rubbish. Will not use them again.\nAlso for the 1st time in 10 years my luggage has ended up in Sydney instead of Perth. Haha I had to laugh at my curiosity to travel with my national airline. They have a long way to go to meet their competitors.","662":"Qantas has cancelled direct flights to and from Melbourne \/ Darwin and return since I first booked flights 5 months ago, firstly they sent me via Adelaide then via Canberra ??? I have changed to Sydney stop over however I rang again to query the loss of my $120 extra leg room seats and waited for 1 hour & 12 minutes only to lose connection, did the operator kindly ring me back?? No of course not, so I then rang again and I am back and fro with another operator who \"keeps checking\" 56 mins later, I just would like what I paid for in extra leg room, obviously direct flights to Darwin are a thing of the past. Never again Qantas, frequent flyer points are not worth the stress.","663":"I write after enduring the worst travel experience in 40 years on the road and feel awful to say it was about QANTAS. We suffered 23 hrs (17 non stop) dark all the way crammed in row 58 of a so called Dreamliner. Qantas ought to be put to shame for cramming 9 wide seats and narrow isles - excise the say - stretch they say - WHERE? - in the loo or in the galley, that's your option. A national disgrace, and they plan to do the whole trip non stop. I see the lovely ads with the people up the front but share a bit of care QANTAS for the sheep down the back.","664":"Qantas is my preferred airline. I fly everywhere with them but this experience makes me want to book with anyone else but Qantas \ud83d\ude1e After leaving 50 mins before boarding like I usually do, and the line to clear security was insane. It was literally to the entrance door! I stood online for 45 minutes and there was a lady ushering people who flew at certain times. But she never called my time so I just broke out of line and lined with people late for their gates. That was stressful as F!! So I realise why it\u2019s taking so long for them to process security checks. There was one line for normal check in and another lane for people late for their gate. Made it as the last passengers were board, but that high anxiety was too much! Cmon Qantas, you\u2019re better than this!","665":"Do not rely, in any way, on QANTAS to assist you in getting from Sydney International terminal to Domestic. You can have a code share ticket and be travelling domestically with QANTAS and if the aircraft you arrived on does not have QANTAS painted on it you will end up standing in an empty transfer terminal for 30-40 minutes without anyone letting you know that you have to make your own way to the domestic terminals.\nAlso be warned, the QANTAS staff have been pre-programmed with a new method to deal with passengers who have been callously disregarded by their employer - they (Johnathon on duty Sydney International 12 Jun 22) will identify you as not being respectful and then in a bullying fashion threaten to have you removed from the next leg of your journey. The threshold for this was simply stating that \"QANTAS doesn't care\". I am a very strong believer in respectful treatment but it is a two way thing and there was nothing in the manner in which QANTAS communicated and dealt with their customers at Sydney that could be consider respectful.\nI am a long term QANTAS customer with over 1 million frequent flyer and over 13000 lifetime status credits and I have never been treated this way by this company - if you have a choice do not transition through Sydney and I, sadly, would suggest you look to other airlines that could not treat you worst than QANTAS.","666":"When you fly Qantas you pay a higher premium that should ensure a superior service, unfortunately that\u2019s no longer the case and the extra money is not worth it. I\u2019m a gold frequent flyer with Qantas and have lost faith in the company. My flight times were changed meaning they were no longer suitable to my needs. I cancelled the flights on app and requested flight credits, the app explained there was a high volume of requests so credits would be delayed. All flight info was then wiped from the app, no credits applied and their customer service refuse to honour the credits as I can\u2019t provide information that their application deleted from my view. Like pulling teeth!","667":"The flight was at 8:15 AM the next morning and we were advised the light was cancelled around 4:00PM the prior evening. New flight details came through later in the evening and we were booked on a 8:00 AM flight with seats down the back. Calles were made to change transport and all was fine. At the airoport we noted that four flights to Sydney had been cancelled and one might expoect many unhappy customers and massive work to fit everyone onto planes that they had not booked. You would think Qantas would know a day or so earlier that there was insufficent customers to justify a flight so why leave until a few hours .Clearly no interest in the customer. As for cost recuction it looked like chaos for those trying to manage the mess.As for the flight it left late, arrived roughly on time which is something.","668":"We were delayed in Sydney for a hour and a half due to short staffing as we were waiting for another crew to land and then take us to our Christchurch, which i know it is not the pilots or host and hostess of our coming flights fault. i have been watching flights that been delayed and praying that ours wasn't gonna be longer then the hour and a half which thankfully wasn't. Our flight staff were awesome and apologetic and made us feel comfortable.\n\nBut....my flight back to Melbourne wasn't fun we didn't leave Christchurch until 2 hr later I had another flight which i had a 4 hr stopover and i thought i had plenty of time. at least i still had 2 hrs to get thru customs and get to my next flight which was flying to Albury and then had a 45 min drive home.I was starting to get really cranky at this time as with the 2 hr wait at Christchurch airport then the 3 hrs flying over then the wait at Melbourne airport i was getting pretty tired, as i was stressed and i just wanted to go home. there were flights being delayed and even cancelled (praying again and hoping my flight wasn't gonna be delayed more ) Which my heart goes out to the passengers that had been waiting there for hrs. On top of that during transition, baggage handlers broken my bag handle which i was very unhappy, which my hubby fixed.\n\nQantas what the heck happened? You guys are one of the best airlines in the world\nBetter pick up your act or peeps are going go looking else where.","669":"4 days delay in luggage arrival. Delay for all of our check ins. No responsible customer care. Made our trip a nightmare and made us so disappointed \ud83d\ude14\nGave us stress and anxiety \ud83d\ude25 which is affecting my health.\n\nNot recommended at all.","670":"Qantas's sad decline: Why the airline which was once the pride of Australia will NEVER return to its former glory - as disgruntled employees blame CEO Alan Joyce and passengers say it's become 'high-cost, low service' This is how the press in Oz write about it and its true. Hard to believe but they make Ryanair seem like saints. damaged luggage .. overcharged on a ticket. up to 3 hour waits to get through to their non-existant CS. horrifying avoid at all costs","671":"I booked to fly Singapore to Canberra via Brisbane. The Singapore to Brisbane sector on the A330 was uneventful.\n\nLanded in Brisbane and there was no announcement that the Brisbane to Canberra sector had been cancelled. Approached the counter and was told that 71 of us have been rebooked via Sydney with a 50 minute connection to Canberra. The Brisbane to Sydney was delayed as they were waiting for a Cabin Manager from another flight. The 50 minute connection soon became 7 minutes. Still the polite Gate staff at BNE assured us that we will make it for the CNB flight as there were 71 of us. The flight on the B737-800 was terrible.\n\nThe seats were filthy and the overhead panels were covered in dust. The in-flight manager announced that the SYD to CNB flight has been cancelled and we Will be re-booked. I had to wait over 5 hours in Sydney for the next flight.\n\nThe Counter staff at Sydney were rude and unapologetic. There was no empathy at all and they seemed proud of the meagre AUD15 meal voucher that they issued.\n\nI finally reached Canberra after a 7 hour delay to find that my luggage had been left behind in Sydney. The guy at the Canberra Baggage counter for Qantas was super rude. He did not offer any assistance and simply told all the affected passengers to fill in a form.\n\nThe luggage was finally delivered to the hotel the following day. This is definitely not the Spirit of Australia.\n\nQantas successfully disappointed a paying customer 3 times in a day.","672":"Booked flight months in advance.

Late getting into Toronto.\nToronto (YYC) to BNE absolute horror trip 24hr turned into 60 with bags arriving 3days later. Boarding Pass issued in YYC via Calgary to LAX. At Calgary discovered at gate my seat had been moved 24hrs (no notice) boarding pass indicated I was booked correctly??

Changing flight status down from Premium and Business to Economy. Already been on phone early today to track down luggage lost on last trip. Will not ever check luggage with qantas. Will actively look to avoid qantas going forward. I was once a loyal customer but can honestly say its service particularly when stuck is useless. I was stuck in Calgary with no flights and no accommodation and Qantas saying it had nothing to do with them and was others fault. No support whatsoever. Was up until 3am trying to organise connections. (I feel really sorry for those stuck in Dallas. (I fortunately travelling by myself). Poor families!","673":"I needed to book a last minute flight due to my father dying and having days to live. I called QANTAS and tried to book a last minute flight. After two hours waiting to even get someone, the best they can do was a flight in three days! Also they tried to charge me a ridiculous price for it. I asked for compassion\/bereavement flight pricing, all the lady could say was, \u201cthat\u2019s the price on the website and that\u2019s what you have to pay.\u201d I used to swear by QANTAS, but not anymore. They would rather rip you off and not allow you to be with family as they die.","674":"I turned up at Brisbane airport with the Qantas E ticket only to find my flight had been cancelled. Staff didn't know why. I told them I also had flights to West Australia in June and hoped they were ok. Qantas staff assured me they were.\n\nI went to check in on June and found they had again cancelled the 4 flights I had booked. Again they could not out would not tell me why. Do I hate them? Yes, till my dieing day!","675":"Just want to warn people not to fly qantas! I recently flew qantas to Perth WA when my luggage was lost in the process. i went to the baggage service at Perth airport to enquire about my missing luggage, to give my contact details and a description on my luggage when i was told to wait till the next flight which was 40 minutes away which i did even though it was almost mid night - my baggage didn't come on this flight, i got a call from Perth baggage service at mid night to ask if i had got my luggage which i hadn't, they said they would be in contact the next day but i was never contacted again.. all numbers i could find online would ring just to disconnect other than the 1300 306 980 which was an hour wait to get though at which i was just told the Perth baggage service would be in contact. After four days of no one contacting me i went back into the Perth airport to the baggage service where i was told there was still nothing on my baggage but there was one in Melbourne which matched the description of the content of my luggage at which time they offered to put it on a flight to Perth and i was told i would be able to get reimbursement for the things i had to buy due to not having my luggage by the customer care form which i did soon as i got home from this trip cutting it short due to not having my luggage but no where on the customer care form did it allow me to add receipts or my bank details to where i would like the reimbursement so i once again called the 1300 number which once again took over an hour to get through to be told someone would be in contact in the following 3 weeks which has now past so i have called the 1300 number again today to be told the process team will be in contact in 6 to 8 weeks and they are processing it when i said i don't understand how they are processing the claim when qantas has not given me somewhere to provide my receipts or bank details and how is it now 6 to 8 weeks when i was told by the last person on this same number that it would be 3 weeks which has now past he proceeded to tell me he couldn't tell me and that someone will be in contact soon (in 6 to 8 weeks) i then asked to speak with his supervisor which time he told me this wasn't a case worth escalating he told i would have to call back if i wanted to speak with the supervisor, at which time he hung up on me. i am beyond disappointed with qantas and want to bring awareness to the fact the company does not care about the stress and grief they cause to their customers!!","676":"The seats are very uncomfortable for a 17hrs flight on dreamlike. The person that designed these seats has never been in one for more than an hour. So thin and metal pressed against you. Would suggest any other Airline for long haul flights","677":"On 11\/06\/22 I flew home to New Zealand from 5 days of work in Canberra.\nOn arrival in Auckland, my bags didn\u2019t arrive and was originally told that they were on a later flight and would be delivered the next day to my home. I was given a sheet that had the file reference along with contact numbers for the Auckland baggage office.\nI accepted this as acceptable and continued on my next flight home without my bag.\nThe next day, no sign of my bags so called the 3 phone numbers provided (of which one only worked). The phone just cutoff after the queue greeting.\nI then emailed them on the provided email address and never got any replies.\nSo I completed the Qantas customer form on their website and included photos and contact details. No response.\nI then emailed Qantas complaints and filed a grievance. No response.\nBy now it was day 4 without any idea where my bag was located.\nI emailed the manager of the baggage counter at Auckland airport asking her to give me a call. I found her details on their website. I just wanted to talk to a human I said.\nAt 2130 that night, I got a call from Auckland airport saying that my bag had arrived from Australia and would be sent to my home town that next day and delivered to my home.\nI finally had my bag delivered as promised on day 5 at 1530.\nIt was intact but strangely missing the red fuzzy ball that I had attached for easy spotting on the baggage carousel.\nIn future I will be investing in an Apple Air Tag to slip it in my bag for tracking if required. I might also stick to Air New Zealand.","678":"The flight and flight crew were excellent. The flight was changed and I was downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy and advised a refund was due.\n\nNumerous hours, emails, phone calls and assurances and it\u2019s now 100 days of no refund.\n\nGood luck anyone imagining the National carrier cared.","679":"Check in was an absolute nightmare as half of the check in counters were not serviceable. The aircraft departed 20 minutes late impacting time-frames at the final destination. The aircraft was not clean with residual crumbs and rubbish on my set and on the floor, whist the in flight entertainment met the QANTAS standard of abysmal.","680":"Check in was relatively painless and the aircraft departed on time. The in-flight entertainment system is reliant on you providing your own device which is quite bizarre for a supposed modern airline. Food and beverage service was bland and tasteless whilst the service was pedestrian.","681":"We had an international points booking we cancelled under Qantas' fly flexible arrangement for classic awards. You are supposed to get a full refund of points and all money paid (including fees, taxes and charges).\n\nLast year we had bookings that took ages to get refunds and they did not refund the credit card fees. We had to chase these up and eventually got the money back.\n\nThis time, we were happy to get the points back overnight and the refund a couple of days later. But they did not refund the credit card fee. Such a rip off. Yet another thing to follow up. I am reporting to the ACCC as they are breaching their own terms and conditions.","682":"You have really dropped the ball lately Qantas. And it\u2019s not just because of Covid!\nI travel weekly to various Pilbara locations, and every flight over the past couple of months has been significantly delayed, changed or cancelled, and I mean literally every flight.\nYou charge a premium (in many eyes a very excessive rate) for regional travel vs interstate or international per km travelled doing very little to promote travel in our own back yard.\nYour inflight service is so basic it compares with third world airline service, and the Qantas club hasn\u2019t changed options for several years, still very basic.\nPick up your game guys, you use to be a world class airline, that cared about your customers, but now your arrogance and greed has set most of your customers against you. Just a shame there isn\u2019t better direct compitition avaliable.","683":"Both my wife and I are Qantas club members costing roughly $1,000 per year. We recently arrived at Sydney airport early as advised and thought we would enjoy the Qantas club, this was not to be.\n\nThere was basically no food apart from a very basic salad, some cold white rice and a lamb curry that contained no lamb that I could find. There was not even cheese and biscuits on offer. The bar was also hopeless, flat sparkling wine and no soda for a vodie either.\n\nWe will not be renewing our membership and will endeavour to fly any other airline other than Qantas or Jetstar.","684":"Where is trip advisor getting their ratings? Most sites are showing 85% with 1star and most wouldn't have rated it that high!\nDelayed flights caused by inept baggage handlers.\nNo one around when the connecting flight takes off before you land because of delays.\nHours and hours waiting for the next flight.\nBaggage left in previous airport with no label put on for connecting flight, so is lost.\n3 days later it is supposed to be delivered 6.30pm to9.30 pm. 11.30 not arrived.\nmy daughter also didn't get her bag on a flight to Uluru. Seems only half of the passengers got their bags.\ndon't waste your time and money on Qantas, because you'll end up paying 10 times more in extra hotel fees because you have to wait days for your luggage.\nThere is absolutely no help to be had for elderly passengers travelling alone.\nGround staff are in short supply - unless they are so ashamed that they go into hiding.\nAlan Joyce should be putting his exhorbitant salary into paying people back for the frustration he is causing.\nI can see Qantas going broke and Joyce laughing all the way to his bank.","685":"I think Qantas overall is a good airline and I think they provide a good service to Australians. I was however very disappointed that they were unable to provide me with a basic vegetarian snack option on a recent interstate flight. Everyone on the plane got handed this egg and bacon quiche and I got handed dried Chinese crackers! How is this possible? Being vegetarian is not uncommon anymore. Every restaurant has at least one decent vegetarian option. It is a main stream requirement for more than 12% of the population which equates to 3.1 million people in Australia. I expected much better from Qantas.","686":"I recently travelled back from Auckland to Melbourne on Qantas flight QF156. All I can say is this was my most disappointing flight ever after over 100+ flights in my life across multiple carriers . Plane was too small for a 4 hr flight with no legroom. Ran out of meals with no alternative options given. Had 3 hours of peoples crotches and behinds in my face whilst waiting for only 2 bathrooms on flight located at back of plane. Staff tried hard but announcements sounded inexperienced and not confident. Air Nz flight to AKL was a million times better. Will avoid Qantas in future because of this experience. Allan Joyce has obviously been more concerned with cost cutting than good customer experience. Poor , ver poor.","687":"I am a frequent flyer and this is the first fight with Qantas in several years, The whole experience has been terrible. We initially booked pre covid so had to cancel the flights a couple of times. Finally when we were able to fly we went online and booked our flights. On check out we were charged the whole fare although we had a credit. So after waiting on the phone for over 6 hours I finally convinced them to send me a refund.\nWell instead of getting the refund sent right away they inform me it will take 8 weeks before they give me my money. We went Business class if you call it that. The space when the seat in front of me was laid back was no more than 150mm so seemed like economy. We wanted to stay in Darwin a couple of extra days so hoped on the website to see what was available. We decided to change the ticket to economy so we could fly out at a schedule that suited us. It showed it will cost us $6 more to fly economy. Anyway we thought we would pay the extra. Well guess what you cant down grade yourself from business to economy. So we had to call and wait on hold again. Finally after complaining they found us seats on business class at no extra cost. So all was good. It was a 1 am flight so I asked for a blanket but was told they don't supply blankets. Never in all my years of flying I could not get a blanket. So all in all not a happy traveller and will never book a flight with Qantas","688":"Terrible. Cancelled, delayed flights is the norm.\nShame on you Allan Joyce.\nGive the 600m assistance back to Government.","689":"Virgin airlines were being terrible as always where our delight was changed till the next day. Staff at virgin didnt seem to know what they were doing so we booked qantas flight about an hour before take off. Was very easy and even though we sat up the back of the plane it was a very good flight. I love the preflight safty presentation video. very creative and always my highlights flying with them","690":"Once again, I am extremely disappointed with Qantas.\n\nI called Qantas customer service on the 19th of May to change the flights from the 20th of May to the 27th of May twice. The staff hung up both times when I asked them to escalate the issue regarding the price. The reason for changing the flight was that my son showed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive on a self-administered Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) and would not be able to travel the next day. A few hours later, I received a new e-ticket with two itineraries departing on the 20th and the 27th and I was relieved that Qantas understood our needs.\n\nOn the 20th of May, I went to LaGuardia airport to confirm that the e-ticket was correct. The American Airlines check-in staff confirmed everything was all right and I asked her to cancel today's flight because my son and wife officially tested positive for COVID-19 at the airport.\n\nToday (25th May), I received a notification from the Qantas app saying that our flights were changed. The Qantas app showed no itinerary for our booking.\nI rang customer service and the staff told me that our flights on the 27th were cancelled because I did not pay for the fare difference. The e-ticket for the 27th did not show that I owed anything and I did not receive any notification of an outstanding balance prior to Qantas cancelling our flight two days before our flight home.\n\nWhat makes matters worse, the staff could not find any seats for the 27th now.\n\nThe drama kept unfolding, I paid for the fare difference of $3,006.42 on the 25th with a Visa card and the staff told me that I would receive a new e-ticket in 30 minutes. However, I did not receive the promised e-ticket until the next day, the 26th at 12:10 pm.\n\nI rang customer service and the representative said that the e-ticket had not been issued and she was requesting an urgent e-ticket request to make sure of it because the ticketing office was closed now. I could not believe that. Qantas flies passengers all over the world. I am very sure that Qantas is aware that the world is divided by different time zones.\n\nI finally received the new e-ticket the next day but I could not select our seats. I have a Gold status for the Qantas Frequent Flyer program so I am entitled to this privilege. I rang customer service requesting a seat arrangement so we could sit together. She told me that she assigned us seats 15D, 15E and 15F on the flight from JFK to LAX and 85D, 85E and 85F on the flight from LAX to SYD. When we arrived at the airport, the seats promised to us were not assigned.\n\nMoreover, the check-in staff told me to pay $100 for extra luggage. I told her that I had a Gold status and I was entitled to free extra luggage. Then she said the system did not have the information regarding my Qantas Frequent Flyer.\n\nI was too naive to believe Qantas when they said it was safe to travel again because you can change flights for free. However, in practice, you are at Qantas' mercy when you are changing your flights. Qantas customer service staff were not professional and seats were not always available or were expensive.\n\nNot only was I ill with COVID-19 while dealing with this, but I was also responsible for taking care of my wife and son who were also sick with COVID-19. I had to make sure we had accommodation to safely isolate and a flight home that Qantas promised us but could not uphold.","691":"Qantas Airline basically provide all the rubbish public customer support number that are\n1. No one would answer the phone.\n2. Someone answered the phone but told me \"I can't help\" or showed attitude of Not my business.\n3. Customer support agent hang up the phone when they don't want to talk ( Because not their business) not even provided ANY useful information\n4. Waiting for hours to get someone on the person redirected me to an email box that is not available anymore ( received email bounce back saying this email address is not in use)\n\nWe have booked a flight with high value of Qantas credit due to Covid rules, we had to cancel the booking and rebook the flight, however, the Qantas Credit is limited to Original passengers to use, not the Qantas Account member to use which caused an huge issue and they don't even care about it. Qantas just took money away and basically not let us talking to all their rubbish ground crew or agents to make us even more angry.\n\nYou will never be able to hear what are the real challenge or market voice, due to poor structure of business operation + low quality of staff that Qantas paid to piss all customer off and damage Qantas as a brand.","692":"I flew business on Qantas Dreamliner in April 2022 to visit family due to a very long absence and a family medical emergency.\nAt checkin I was greeted by a surly miserable assistant who couldn\u2019t give me a window seat even though I\u2019d requested one on line and had also arrived early to be first in line. I had also tried from booking my flight to select my seat everyday for both the flights without success. Her attitude was rude, unapologetic, dismissive and couldn\u2019t care less, she waved her hand at me and told me to go to customer services. Then checking my luggage onto the belt she refused to move to assist to help, then after I\u2019d put my case onto the belt she told me to turn it around after seeing me struggling. She insisted the case was to heavy it was below 28kg way below my allowance.\nThe flight was delayed I then again enquired at the gate to the flight attendant about my window seat who advised me he couldn\u2019t do anything as the seats were all allocated, he advised me to write a letter of complaint to customer service. Paying for a business class return so I could arrive rested and feel comfortable during the flight was not going to happen if I was seated next to a baby. The seat numbers were aisle pods where the bassinet was and directly opposite the toilet.Fortunately that didn\u2019t happen, however worse was to follow.\nThe seat I was placed in hadn\u2019t been cleaned to a hygienic standard the remote compartment was dirty, I asked an attendant to clean it and he rolled his eyes in disgust at me then briefly wiped the tray, I then spent some time with my wipes cleaning the dirt properly and surrounding areas. Considering Qantas insists on face masks for the flight even though passengers are vaccinated seems to be a contradictory request in view of the fact my seat and the toilets were dirty. Hygiene was slack. One stewardess in particular was the mask police and requested more than once to passengers to put their mask on!\nAfter the long delay, my first meal was served being vegan I\u2019d requested strict Asian Vegan, after previously having a bad vegan meal on a Qantas flight I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t get a vegan meal as the meal requests don\u2019t offer vegan only vegetarian vegan, this isn\u2019t a clear definition. My meal Melbourne to Darwin was disgusting it was a watery Dahl. The only decent edible part was the fresh fruit.\nDarwin to London I was again served another version of the first meal I complained to the flight attendant. Obviously it\u2019s not their fault but it had to be voiced. I was later offered breakfast then another flight attendant argued with me that oats and a sourdough crumpet weren\u2019t vegan! and questioned my choice of having the vegan breakfast or the breakfast from the menu, is already been offered the choice of both incase the vegan meal was inedible, breakfast was served the oats were swimming in almond milk and the crumpet was a cold, uncooked soggy lump of dough it went back to be heated and returned much the same. I was by this time so angry that I\u2019d spent thousands and thousand of dollars on flights that were absolutely awful so much for being named the Dreamliner my experience for the first duration was a nightmare.\nWhen I arrived at Heathrow it took me a week to recover from food poisoning from the flight food, this was added to my personal stress. I had paid for this flight wanting to arrive fit and rested to deal with the ordeal of my family\u2019s medical problems instead I felt exhausted and ill.\nI wrote as advised to complain to Qantas mid April and haven\u2019t received a reply to either email the first or the second one written on my return home three weeks later.\nMy return flight was more of the same, delays with take off, exact same food complaints and disappointment at the unacceptable slack sub standard service. The only redeeming part was I managed to reserve a window seat so had a single pod.\nThe duration with all the delays did not make it any faster or efficient than flying with another airline. The cost for the a business class flight was excessive for the food and service I received. My meal costs for a few dollars worth of lentils and fruit served on a side plate were insulting.\nI suggest the CEO take a trip on this flight and order the same meals. If he and I were served this slop in a restaurant you\u2019d get up and walk out without paying. I however had to be subjected to this unacceptable situation both ways and all meals and pay thousands of dollars. I feel ripped off and badly let down.\nI also suggest that Qantas put some input and money into employment, they can\u2019t answer two serious complaints within two months but can spend spend spend on advertising and spamming me with notifications about their deals. They can\u2019t answer calls and you can\u2019t speak to anyone.\nGet your priorities right, customer service and consideration is paramount. You\u2019ve lost my loyalty I will not fly Qantas again. It\u2019s a disgrace and should be renamed the Nightmare liner.","693":"No hassles at check-in. Polite people who gladly put our large and heavy bags onto the flights. We were doing 4 flights in total and each was similar. The food was superior to JET STAR (also on the itinerary). So, in short, I'd pick Qantas for intra-Oceania flights every time.\n\nAnd, believe it or not, all 4 landings were smooth as silk.","694":"Flight was cancelled in 2020 due to Covid. It is now June 2022 and I still don't have a refund.\nThey wanted me to use travelpass however they broke the total amount across two travel passes so I can't use both on one booking unless the total of the new booking is less then combined travel pass.\nWell flight prices have gone way up at qantas. to the point where it's actually cheaper for me to book with Air Canada and not use my travelpass at all.\nAnyhow I will continue to keep trying to get a refund from a company that will not answer their phones and will not provide any other way of obtaining a refund other thand call a number every 4 weeks and waiting on hold for 10-14 hours only to be told \"you will get an email\". and never do.\nClean up your act Qantas of just fold it in, stop pretending you are still in business!","695":"So when thing go bad, there is no help. No response except blame the connecting airline. Late flight into lax, no help trying to make connection. Changed flight, but not told, so runing over to gate was useless, as seat was given away. Not given hotel voucher for night stuck in Las Angeles.\nLate luggage, no payment for $35 for essentials and damaged baggage, no response for a week to say not our fault, contact your first airline, but now it is too late.","696":"My baggage was delay on my flight on may 22. Its been 12 days of the most streefull experiencie in my life.\n\nI completed the form of delayed baggage at the Airport they told me they will Call me and they did not call. I have been losing 4 hours per day trying to contact them and also money because i have no clothes and no medicine.At May 24 they told me my baggage was in Brisbane and they will deliver it on the 25 of may,the bagagge did not arrive. Then i went to the Airport because they told me my bagagge was there and yes they did not find it. They make me lose my time and money. I moved to Airlie Beach and they should Call me if they find the baggage and sent it here and they didnt. I have to call again and yes my bagagge arrived to prospine Airport on the 29 of May, its been 4 days and they can not sent the baggage to the hostel because they are a mess.\n\nThey also told me i can have a Refund for the clothes i have to buy but there is no answer. Its been the most horrible time for me , the worst first days in Australia because of Qantas Poor customer service.\n\nNow i am waiting for them to deliver it today, if not i will have to pay extra 40 AUD to go to the AirPort and i have been spending more tan 400 AUD to dress and have medicine here. Do you think thats fair ? I experienced the worst service in my life with Qantas","697":"I am a very frequent international traveller and was flying from the Gold Coast via Sydney to Bangkok. First the local flight was so late i missed the Bangkok connection. I could only get a flight the next day so now they can't find my luggage. After 2 hours waiting i went to my hotel, now after 8 hours and 2 hours on the phone they can't dp anything, their so called customer services said he can't get anyone on the phone sporry. I asked to speak to a supervisor he wouldn't let me do that. So now I a don't know where my baggage is and I fly in the morning. What a load of rubbish Qantas is. NEVER AGAIN no stars is too many for this load of garbage","698":"What is happening to Qantas post COVID? Jakarta flights this week from Sydney have been delayed up to 8 hours. Arriving wee hours in the morning. Don\u2019t schedule flights if you do not have new enough aircraft, or service worthy aircraft to service customers \u2026.","699":"I had a pretty good experience with Qantas. Entertainment options were extensive, including tv-shows and movies. Staff were generally pleasant and the aircraft was clean. The food was good but could have been more generous considering the flight was 15 hours. Leg-room was also quite limited in economy class, considering the length of the flight.","700":"Had 5 passengers flying from Mildura\nto Brisbane. Upon arrival in BNE, four out of 5 bags had been misplaced. Excessive time looking for baggage resulted in a financial loss ( non refundable event reservation)\n\nTo the returning flight, BNE to MLQ Upon arrival all 5 bags were lost and never recovered.\n\nI emailed a complaint to qantas and never got a reply.

What does QANTAS stand for today? Quick And Nasty Typical Australian Service. Having been a frequent flyer member for 25 years, the appalling experience today has not only ssaddened me, but impelled me to write this review.\n\nOk it's difficult times we are all facing, but the service standards of qantas are now unrecognisable as the brand I've supported all these years.\n\nIt went like this, tickets booked, Adl Syd Return, informed a week before travel of return flight reschedule.\n\nOriginal ticketing; depart Syd for return flight 12:40, new flight time depart 10:40. No explanation just stiff luck. Weekend away now cut short.\n\nDay of departure 3 hour delay arrive into Syd hotel at 17:30. Further eating into our break.\n\nDay of return informed at 8:30 am, as we are checking out of hotel (much earlier than we wanted to) 10:40 flight now cancelled. No explanation, no rescheduled time provided.\n\nDo we stay in hotel and enjoy breakfast or go to airport? We decide go to airport to sort out return flight, just in case return flight is early.\n\nBedlam at Syd airport as many other flights are also cancelled.\n\nOn ground qantas reps, rude abrupt and unhelpful. Queue for 'service rep', informed new flight time is 12:10. Thirty min before our original ticketing! Ridiculous.\n\nMake way to Qantas Club (annual fee of $500), staff are rude, snappy and abrupt. This is from entrance to coffee to floor staff, staff talk amongst themselves and ignore guests.\n\nFood below standard, club filthy with dirty plates, glasses coffee cups strewn all over every table.\n\nCan't charge phone as no USB ports in lounge. 3 hour wait in lounge with staff that couldn't care less about customer experience. This is in Australia's biggest city! It's 2022 and after all the talk of being excited to welcome customers back this is acceptable 'standards'.\n\nBoard flight, cabin crew surly, no smiles, no attempt to make it a pleasant experience in full knowledge of the delay customers have experienced.\n\nOverhead luggage bins slammed shut, we take off. 'Lunch' is a pathetic sandwich shoved in our face by one of the aforementioned surly crew, with arm stretched out. No explanation, no pleasantries. Collection of 'rubbish' is perfunctory and just as bad as the 'service' delivery.\n\nSummation: what was once a great reliable Qantas experience is now the sub standards of a low cost airline whilst paying premium prices. The customer is now, it seems to me, an inconvenience and the last priority of both ground crew and on board staff. To say its a disappointment is an understatement. Lift your game QANTAS or lose your customer base. People want and deserve reliable and pleasant service, and at a premium price we bloody deserve it.","703":"Had to cancel flights because of flu. Called 131313 and got flight canceled (after on hold for 1 hour and 3 minutes) with the promise that credits will be provided within 24 hours. We didn\u2019t receive anything for 26 hours and then called again. After waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes we finally got served by someone. We explained our situation who asked us to hold while he was checking. We were on hold for 30 minutes and our call was cut off. 1 hour and 40 minutes wasted. On a call again with 131313 and in queue for 33 minutes to get help!","704":"I bought a ticket with Qantas because I'm Australian and I used to believe in the Australian airline - I'm even a frequent flyer since more than a decade. NEVER AGAIN. Despite all its \"fully flexible\" and \"no booking fees\" promises, it is an absolute nightmare to rebook. In April I tried to use my \"credit voucher\" to book another flight, it took 3 calls each waiting 1-2 hours before even being answered by a human. I am still waiting for my refund for the price difference almost 2 months later - I called Qantas today and was told \"it wasn't put through\". I have cancelled my flight as I have zero faith in Qantas, and I'm told the refund will take 8 weeks. Don't give these guys your money - you won't see it back.","705":"I bought a bottle of duty-free whisky on a connecting flight worth $300 AUD. I transited through Bangkok and the security lady grabbed my whiskey and confiscated it. Of course, I tried to reason with her and she replied saying no liquid over 100ml is allowed. It is a duty-free liquor sealed in a plastic bag, How is it reasonable that duty-free bought from Bangkok airport are allowed on the flight but confiscated if they are purchased from another airline. 300 dollars down the drain or some office in Thailand is enjoying it. Be warned and don't bring any duty-free liquor if originating from Thailand.","706":"I still have some outstanding customer service matters to be dealt with by Qantas and I am still shocked by the poor service levels. You just can't keep blaming COVID...\n\nI have lodged a compliant about my flight and asked to be provided with the amenity kit that was not loaded, as well as giving them feedback on the broken tap in business class toilet and the running out of food (we don't often travel business so were really disappointed not to get the full service). No reply.\n\nI am also chasing hotel points from December last year - the hotel keep telling me they have sent the \"file\" to Qantas who won't process it. Their useless customer service people didn't read my emails properly. I've now sent them the tax invoice and the booking information. No points and no reply (aside from a reference number).\n\nI hope all customers get good service - but I am gold frequent flyer (lifetime silver) so you would hope for better responses than this. I wonder how long poor Bronze people are waiting for a reply...\n\nNot good enough at all - I would expect by now that they could put on more staff to deal with this backlog of queries. They still charge top dollar and charge companies money to issue points.","707":"My wife and I have been flying with Qantas for many years. On the flight from Perth to Sydney, she sent back the hot breakfast as it was atrocious. On the return flight from Sydney to Perth, there was a change of aircraft with no email advising us of the change. We lost our preferred seats and were also seated separately on the plane- 45 min on hold on the phone to sort that out. Then a long delay at the airport and a delay in the flying time. Total time airport to airport was in excess of seven hours. Sadly, Qantas cannot keep blaming COVID for the cut backs. It was a world leader but that is debatable now.","708":"Qantas cancelled flight to Melbourne when covid lockdown instigated by Vic health may 2021. Issued flight credit.\nWhen you try to use it you are directed to a phone contact and told you cannot use credit for online booking.\nTry to call number only to wait hours with no one answering customer service number.\nNow according to email with credit for flight period to use has expired.\nSo they keep my money I get nothing and we the taxpayer gave money to this company to prop it up during early period of covid when they were forced to stop services.\n\nThis company has no code of ethics or feels a moral obligation to provide a service paid for. They currently hold 1.4 billion Australian dollars worth of flight credits.\nDon't think they won't try to keep it by doing us out of those credits!\n\nIf I could rate them zero I would","709":"This 2 hour 30 minute flight up the west coast was by QantasLink on one of their A320 aircraft. Not a bad flight with good legroom in economy and friendly cabin staff. Boarding was quick and efficient and we got away on time. Would travel with Qantas again on this route.","710":"Mr Joyce asks are we \"battle ready\" for travel? You have one job Mr Joyce, provide a premium level product that gets folks from A --> B safely with as little fuss as possible.\n\nOn recent purchase of international flights after 3 years of lock down, your on line booking system triple charged me for the same booking, my only recourse to rectify this over-reach by your IT system was to call the customer help center, I did, it took 5 hours and 30 minutes to get a customer service consultant.\n\n5 hours and 30 minutes, it takes less time to fly from Sydney to Perth! and you have the audacity to say the public needs to be \"battle ready\" for queues and wait times... imagine your plane had 5 hours and 30 minutes less fuel than it required for its flight? Disaster!\n\nIt gets worse, after the 5 and 1\/2 hr wait not only was the call center (based in South Africa) unable to release my credit card funds from my initial booking, it mad a supplementary charge, that not only failed to issue a ticket it further locked up more of my credit card funds for some pending booking.\n\nEventually to rectify the situation I drove to Sydney Airport to deal direct with the sales counter, guess what? Mr Joyce closed all of those too. So the nice check counter manager gave me the secret number they use for the call center in Hobart! This time, after only an hour and a half wait, (still quicker to fly to Melbourne), The Hobart booking center (who were really nice btw) were able to finally book and issue me with tickets. I still had to wait a further 14 days for all the overcharges to be refunded! (or more specifically released)\n\nHere is the kicker, Qantas blamed the bank, said it was their fault, but after an ABC News story and follow up on my part, turns out Qantas has over 150 of these double charges per week, that it happens to Commonwealth, St George and Westpac customers, that its not the banks fault and its been happening since November 2021.\n\nLets hope my analogy does not prove true and that Qantas' commitment to Air safety is better than the systemic failures its booking department exhibits.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, my issue with Qantas remains unresolved. I have written to their Customer Support expressing my concerns, including but not limited to 'unfair bargaining advantage', poor service, misappropriation and false and misleading statements in the procurement of goods and services. I have heard nothing back.\n\nLuckily Trip Advisor has weathered the pandemic and remains at all travelers disposal as a great forum to openly discuss the shortcomings of poor service and monopolistic arrogance","711":"I would gave given this review 0 stars if possible. First of all, cancelled my flights, not a problem, things happen, giving me an option for a refund or alternative flight. However, the fact that upon requesting for a refund, i found out that they put me on a flight, without my permission, 3 days away from original flight, is ridiculous, alongside changing my return flights without informing me? Not only this, but when I tried ringing for support, took over an hour to get through to someone. sort your sh** out qantas, you are a joke of an airline company.","712":"was was charged more than 4000 aud in error during a recent simple flight booking!\nSTAY away from these corrupt time wasters\nCall waits 3 hrs , EMAILS UNANSWERED, lines dropped, and simply been lied to FORGET THEM","713":"We have travelled Premium Economy flights with Qantas several times over the years as my husband is a tall man and requires extra legroom.\n\nThis time was the most uncomfortable and painful journey for him.because of the now reduced legroom. He had to sit with his legs to one side for about 23 hours which has caused considerable discomfort ever since. Both flights to and from London were the same.\n\nWe had already endured the debacle with Qantas having to offload some passengers' bags in Darwin due to weight problems caused by runway damage there. The possibility that we may not receive our bags in London was only notified to us in a text message on the way to the airport! This despite the fact that Qantas had known about the problems for 3 days. Fortunately after waiting ages our luggage arrived which was a relief as we were heading on to Iceland..","714":"My Complaint is about a flight and a refund.\nI had to travel to Sydney and this was a last minute booking.\nI booked and flew on 7th May 2022 wellington to Auckland, Auckland to Sydney reference 53TzDX (this has not been added to my frequent flyer points), I was unable to log onto your web site to choose a seat or request meal option, on arrival to Auckland airport another traveller I got talking to shared her bad experience with your airline and wished me luck, the seat I was allocated wasn't bad for economy but over priced at $856.37 AU , the boxed cold slop that was plonked down in front of me reminded me of school dinners, not nice at all, a row in front and to my right the couple spent the flight getting intoxicated with cabin staff suppling drinks constantly also consuming duty free ,they were disruptive to other passengers and at one stage rather abusive to the two young lady's behind them also the intoxicated female wet her self and continually went past to the bathroom.\nI had booked to fly home with Qantas Reference 546KYY this was causing anxiety as I had not had a great experience with my first flight with you, I was able to cancel this flight for a refund only to now follow up to see that the refund will take up to 8 weeks NOT GOOD QANTAS, I was able rebook with Air New Zealand premium economy for much less and 5 star service,\nI am in the hospitality and tourism industry and found this whole experience well below average, We travel quite regular and would not recommend Qantas.\nMaybe there needs to be some positive changes to your service.\nI do understand this complaint will be another to add to the look at later pile and get swept under the carpet.\nRegards\nTracey","715":"Qantas has gone from being a great airline to being horrendous. Where to start - my flights to London have been changed\/cancelled THREE times - the most recent change being 24 HOURS later than the booked flight. No alternate options provided, no decline option. As part of the booking included a pre-pandemic flight credit, the only way to make changes is via phone. Phone wait times are 1 - 3+ hours, even as a Silver member. I even had to call (2.5hr wait) to choose seats - somehow the Qantas site malfunctions - only to receive an email weeks later to state the flight had been cancelled and I was placed on another flight 24 hour later; 'click to accept'. The audacity to include a note in the email 'we have very long phone wait times, do not call us unless your flight is within 7 days'. No bot to assist. No call-back options. I am hardly going to wait 7 days before a huge international trip to confirm\/rebook flights??! AND when I did call (1.5hr) and got put on hold, I was hung up on - suddenly the call terminated. I waited 2 hours - no call back from the customer service agent. These flights cost 4K, and I will pursue a full refund and fly with another airline. Qantas you are bottom of the barrel. Never. Again.","716":"Qantas you have slipped dramatically. Been flying for years and each time not as good as last time. Uniforms are getting jaded. Food is at best ok. Service well, depends on the flight. Generally the flight crew are rushed off their feet and look not at peak performance. The planes are smudgee, the entertainment menu slack. Has Qantas pushed in another row of seats? Feels like it. Check in staff in Sydney effectively not great, accept the lady who served me in Sydney. I asked about quick service to catch connecting flight, all I got was\"back of the queue and that includes the Shuttle bus service. Grumpy old men! Sorry Qantas you need a kick right where my foot fits. Smarten up as you are more and more looking like a budget airline.","717":"Life time gold member, 30 year platinum member. Booiked frequent flyer seats to Europe 9 months ago with QF, they recently cancelled the Australia\/Europe sector stating flights had been cancelled. Flights have not been cancelled, can still book full paying fares, appears someone at Qantas is acting unethically here. Have been chasing QF for 3 weeks (6-8 times thus far), unable to gte a single response, phone wait times 4-6 hours. Actually this looks like a Qantas scam, cancelled our booking, told us the flights had been canc elled, we can still see that booking are available. Qantas integrity a major concern.","718":"I had never flown on Qantas before, but over the previous few weeks, all I was hearing was how horrible they had become in recent months. I had a flyer mile international flight already booked, and the thought of a 16-hour flight with an airline from hell was scaring the bejesus out of me. No lie, for days, I attempted to find a flight on another airline, to no avail. So with the deadline approaching, I resolved to bite the bullet and suffer.\n\nI am in amazement! It was not only a fabulous flight but one of the best that I have ever had! The jet was clean and pristine and one of the most modern that I had experienced. It had swivelling-back-headrest entertainment screens, an alternate rest specifically for ipads and the like, power outlets, and plenty of USB ports, and the headphones had praiseworthy sound quality. Fabulous food, comfy footrests and headrests that adjusted height and flexed to hold my heavy head (the first time the gadget has worked).\n\nBut most of all, it was the CREW! From the start, the cabin crew was outstanding. Generous, friendly, and top-notch. Probably the best team that I've ever flown with. From the moment I stepped on, they were accommodating\u2014helping me get a different seat, providing me with extra treats, always being there for water and grabbing garbage. Amusing and approachable\u2014they loved their work. I hope you will somehow have the fortune of flying with Jess, Pedro or Poal; if you get one of them on your flight, you are good. If you get all of them, you're golden.\n\nFortunately, my flight was barely full, and each person had enough free seats next to them to lie down entirely. That reminds me, I have to mention the bedding. For once, I can call it bedding. The pillows were genuine soft pillows, and the blanket was exquisitely pretty and absolutely cozy.\n\nBefore disembarking, I had to be straight up with my new mates and warn them of their trip advisor nasty rap. \"Ugh!\" they replied, \"We know! Qantas had a shaky start coming back post-pandemic, but we're back now.\" I then confessed that I searched hell and high water for an alternate flight and was now happy to have been unsuccessful. They threw up their hands in unison with mock disappointment. \"How could you betray Qantas so!\" they jokingly gasped. I assured them that it was a big mistake and that I'd write a great review to make it up to them. So here is that review, and I'm hoping that all your loyal flyers get back on board.\n\nTHANK YOU, QANTAS!","719":"This flight does not operate everyday but it is great to not have to change on the mainland. The Qantas Business lounge in Canberra was a good place to start the journey with bacon and eggs. The 717 was not full and I had an exit row seat and a free seat next to me. On this flight the entertainment was working and they served hot tea. The snack was a tiny pack of biscuits... so overall and ok flight but for $275 I would expect a breakfast tray. The flight arrived on time and the bag came off fast as it was priority tagged.","720":"Despite my numerous messages and phone calls, I have not been able to contact anyone from Qantas Airways regarding my booking. I just managed again to speak to someone on the phone after a very lengthy wait, to be disconnected without any warning. Your team is asking for all callers to be polite, and I am one of them - I however feel humiliated by how am being treated by this organisation. I will do everything in my power now to share my experience with greater public. To say that I am disappointed is huge understatement.\nWe had our bookings changed and cancelled without any warning and notice and are bound to fly to Europe in under 3 weeks time - we are travelling with children","721":"Qantas VH UTF\n\nLift your game our National Carrier\nAllan hop on and do some random quality and cleanliness checks of your product.

So nothing to eat on a 3 hour flight at lunchtime.\nAfter lunch served to others they packed the Trolley away and disappeared zero service after 1 hour of flying.\nEconomy was served before us as our hostess seemed very busy packing a trolley for 4 Business Class passengers.\nWhen we got on and sat down I asked to move seats due to mine being broken and laying back in race position (that I had told them about a week ago on the first flight) seat 4E. No was the answer must keep seat position.\nMust be too busy painting them to look pretty and the new livery and not looking after the inside where customers sit.\nFilthy chairs with drink down the side from over a week old seat 3A take a look for yourself it will still be there.\nOver an hour to get served or even a water on the first flight QF1987 11th May sitting in seats 4E & 4F\n45 mins for service on return flight QF1988 17th May same seats both flights on same plane.\nHave flown Business internationally with Qantas and more than happy with the service and quality but last time we flew with them domestically was 4 years ago and had similar issues.

The flight board showed on time and the app was showing on time so I went to the gate as there was not much connecting time. The plane was being towed to the gate and it was obvious that it was not going to go on time. However, nothing was updated - so much for Qantas saying rely on the app!\n\nIn the end we left 20 minutes late. There was no real reason aside from some vague comment about cleaning - surely the plane should have been cleaned before it was towed to the gate?\n\nThe catering was very average - yet another muffin and no hot drinks offered - just water. At last the entertainment streaming was working on the sector.\n\nOn my previous flight I had sat at the exit with no-one next to me, but on this flight, the attendant insisted on moving someone next to me - she said it was just for takeoff and landing? I've never seen that before and I often sit in exit rows on this plane. On an emptyish plane during a pandemic, why make people sit next to each other when they don't have to and don't want to?","723":"I took the 6am early morning flight from Hobart to connect to Canberra. The flight left early and landed early which was great as I only had a short connecting time. I was disappointed that there was no entertainment streaming onboard and the \"catering\" was a tiny muffin and a bottle of water. What happened to serving tea and coffee? They used to do it and I don't think Melbourne has moved closer to Hobart - there is plenty of time to do a proper service. Qantas market that you get catering and entertainment onboard - and they charge more. So if they don't provide it, I might as well fly Jetstar at a cheaper price.\n\nI had an exit row with non-one next to me, so the flight was comfy from a space perspective.","724":"Last year encouraged by Qantas's reassurance \"we're back!\" I booked a return flight to the US to visit our daughter this July 2022.\n\nA few months ago 1 of 2 legs home on JAL was cancelled and I had to find another way home which I did. But in the last few hours both our Cathay legs to the US have been canceled. The first one I was notified. The 2nd one - nothing. f I hadn't happened to check my account I wouldn't have known.\n\nThe QANTAS FF call centre pre-COVID was fantastic - this time the agent was clearly unwell blowing her nose and sneezing, sighing and saying, \"Oh no! Oh no!!\" every time her searches for an alternative flight were unsuccessful. If it wasn't so distressing it might have been funny. One day I will laugh.\n\nFinally asked to be transferred to a 2nd agent to help me use vouchers to see if I could purchase commercial flights instead. She asked me to give her the numbers for the vouchers which I didn't have in front of me. Qantas has these vouchers on record but shifts the burden onto you to tell them - if you can't work it out yourself they won't help. She hung up on me.","725":"Today I had the misfortune to experience one of the rudest check assistants I have ever experienced in my many years of flying around the world. This individual seemed to have completely forgotten that they are supplying a customer service not doing is a favour by allowing us to travel.\n\nI have been a regular traveller on Qantas airlines over the years, however this level of rudeness and lack of customer acknowledgment is a first. Hopefully not a sign of things to come for Qantas.","726":"What a terrible experience. I remember why I don't fly Qantas anymore. From the start the lack of enthusiasm from the start was not welcoming at all. Virgin and Jetstar have far more professionalism than Qantas. My luggage was misplaced from a connecting flight in Sydney. It wasn't the issue of my bag being misplaced but the lack of communication from Qantas to update me on the location and the arrival. I spent 32 minutes on hold on the phone only for it to hang up. It is so hard to navigate on the Qantas website to find out the location and when I did I still have had no response. The brand has been so detached from reality I think its time they put someone less corporate and more employee centric to be at the top of the brand. A shame this is happening to an iconic brand.","727":"1. On my flight from Canberra to Sydney, the lifejacket fell out from under the seat and the seat squab seemed on the verge of collapse.\n1. a. I was charged 100 excess baggage for my garment bag, which seems outrageous.\n2. On my return, Sydney - Canberra: I checked in bags. Same issue with my suit, so I wait two hours in a queue to pay the excess. I get to the end, only to be redirected by a brusque (actually outright rude) woman to another queue to what is called a \"kiosk.\" Actually, the \"kiosk\" is the automatic check in machine. There was a queue since a great number of them were not operational.\n2 a. I make the aeroplane with what I expect are minutes to spare, but there is a delay.\n2 b. I board and yes, we wait in our seats with no air conditioning for another whole hour before the engines start.\nThe disregard for passengers -- except for their money -- is hard to stomach.","728":"Thanks, well done. Nice food , friendly service and staff. I would change safety video when you brace put your head into media screen. Look at it , comment on E cigarette change this as well.

This was my first post pandemic trip and it was a nightmare!! First, you cannot call them (I waited 7 hours on hold and others have reported 20 hour waits) so when they cancelled exit seats I had paid for and were confirmed - I couldn\u2019t call to enquire or request a refund. All 3 Qantas flights on my trip were significantly delayed and there was literally no ground staff assistance with domestic transfer in Sydney. The aircraft for the 14+ hour flight is ludicrously packed in economy - if you\u2019re average height there is insufficient space and if you\u2019re a bigger person it is super uncomfortable. The \u201cfood\u201d was barely edible (in fairness these were vegetarian meals). The only consistent is the staff is really helpful as always.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d say this but I will look for a different carrier on my frequent trips to America","730":"Delayed for an hour & a half with no updates or explanation. The seats are extremely cramped with knees touching the back of the seat in front of you. No water throughout the flight was offered.\n\nWe booked into the Ibis airport hotel for a stop over before flying into Queens town.\nIt was announced that the footpath to the hotel was being repaired & was not in service, but there would be a shuttle bus placed on.\n\nAfter leaving the airport, we stood around like others, for an hour & a half. No one to ask as the airport was a ghost town. (Someone explained that after 11pm, there\u2019s only one flight coming into Auckland so not even taxi drivers come to the airport! ) We didn\u2019t land until 1am due to the flight delay.\n\nEnded up getting a taxi ( airport staff summoned them) that cost us $30 for a 5 min drive!!!!\n\nI\u2019d expect better from Qantas & the money they charge.","731":"Qantas have to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. Paying a premium fee for a substandard service. Our flights were booked 7 months in advance and cancelled two weeks prior to departure via email. No options given just a notification of the flight we have been moved to 48 hours later. 4 hours on hold to speak with the most useless customer service team to attempt rebook another flight. Qantas could not accommodate with affiliate airlines that they have advertised and sold on their website As we needed to arrive on the same day we had to have an extra 6 hours in transit.\n\nWe paid an additional fee to have a bassinet seat and was told that they this would not be available on our rebooked flight.","732":"Good on time performance and service. When is Qantas Club COVID refurbishment in Rockhampton opening ?","733":"I was meant to get a refund for something. They said it could take up to 6 weeks so I waited 8 weeks and then started to try to contact them again. So for the past month I have been trying to call. I have called at times when I have been able to wait on hold for 2 hours but no longer so a few times I have had to hang up. Other times I will be on hold and then get disconnected. The money still hasn't come into my account and we have now cancelled that credit card account so I need to speak to someone but there is no way I can do this other than phone. What am I meant to do here? Is there some kind of ombudsmen I can contact? They really need to hire more staff to answer phones or have some kind of email system. I contacted them through Facebook a few times but had no response.","734":"This is an Airbus A330-300 2-4-2 configuration. Seating is very tight. Width is ok, but the pitch at 31 inches will have your knees touching the seat in front. The flight was 50% full so thankfully we had empty seats all around us. As opposed to our flight to SYD, this flight was on time and had little problems except when arriving in BKK. The plane did 3 360\"s before landing. Maybe traffic at BKK, not sure, but did delay us a bit. Service on board was satisfactory, a meal and packaged snack. AV service was not that great. See my review of QF24 also. For me seating and comfort will be an issue and I doubt I could take this flight again unless in biz class.","735":"This is an Airbus A330-300, 2-4-2 configuration. Seating is tight. Width is ok, but pitch at 31 inches is very tight. Also avoid window seats. The seats are smaller and with the curvature of the window will be extremely uncomfortable unless you are a child or very skinny. I am not. Pity they recline the seat in front of you. We left BKK one and half hours late. When we arrived in SYD, the plane pulled up to the gate and turned off seat belt sign. The plane which was about 50% full, people got up and filled the aisles waiting to deplane. After standing for about 15 minutes, the Captain announced they had overshot the landing spot and had to back the plane up to meet the sky bridge, which I always thought was flexible to align with the plane door. So we all had to sit again, and about 40 minutes later finally left the aircraft. After going thru security and passport control went to baggage claim, except there was no baggage. We were told there was a staff shortage and they would get to it. Finally after 45 minutes the bags appeared. It was a trying event to say the least. Overall the flight, while in the air was good, service was likewise fine, with a meal and then a packaged snack. I doubt I would take this flight again unless in biz class.","736":"I fly Qantas weekly for work and have done so for several years. I can definitely say that Qantas has gone from a really good airline to something that is probably not even repairable. I recently had my call light on in the flight for probably close to 1 hour and eventually turned it off. Dont even get offered a drink. The flight staff has turned really rude like dont care about their job or dont even want to work anymore. Disgusting to watch.","737":"United flight booked through Qantas and part of my ticket was 4 hours late out of Denver so missed the connecting flight in LA. No way to contact Qantas, no way to book an ongoing flight, no accommodation, no transport. A 3 hour wait to be connected to Qantas blew my phone out. Eventually someone in Melbourne spent 4 hours and managed to get me booked on another flight but 2 days later which killed my covid test. Then a booking on the next day appeared but on the same booking reference as the later flight so couldn't cancel the later flight. Can't believe I paid to live this nightmare brought about by the total lack of communication available with my provider, Qantas. When I complained later I received a glib response about inability to predict peak times but no compensation for my expenses.","738":"I booked a direct flight from LHR to Perth WA in October 2021 to travel in April 2022, paying a significant premium over other airlines. This was because I wanted to minimise the chance of being infected enroute to Australia and having to quarantine. In March 2021 I received an email from Qantas informing me that my flight had changed to staging through Darwin, extending my travel time by 7 hours. Not only did this totally negate my paying to fly Qantas anyway, but the flight times on both the outward and return trip were very inconvenient. I tried repeatedly to change my flight to Emirates, an alternative carrier offered on the Qantas website, but their system crashed every time I tried to do this. I spent hours on the Customer Services contact number but never got an answer, even at 0200 in the morning. Fellow passengers on the flights reported similar experiences. When actually airborne with Qantas, the food was the worst I have ever been served on any airline, and, to cap it all, we were bombarded constantly with messages to maintain social distancing on a packed aircraft, which was patently impossible. The old adage that Qantas stands for Quite a Nauseating Trip and Service is obviously something this dreadful airline works hard to live up to. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.","739":"Bag not loaded in Melbourne but still can't find 2 weeks later, only one email since then - from their contractor Menzies Aviation who don't seem to care - their only advice was to claim compensation, which is very poor given I recently renewed my Frequent Flyer status and rejoined the Qantas Club. Too bad obviously about my lost items of sentimental value. This short trans-Tasman flight was the first I had taken with Qantas in many years; it will be my last.","740":"Flight got cancelled during covid lockdowns, but they've refunded only half of it, and it's impossible to get to them to resolve, hours waiting on the line.

We used to fly qantas all the time they were the best, however after our recent experience with them they are quickly becoming the worst and our choice will not be Qantas.","748":"They decided to cancel my flight at 9:20pm with an original departure of 0600. They automatically changed my booking to a flight that will delay my travel by 4 hours causing me to miss my event. They changed me from a Qantas flight to a budget Jetstar price with nil reimbursement. Their 24\/7 phone line has been useless as I am still on hold over an hour later. I won't be flying with Qantas again until Alan Joyce is gone, he has runied this airline more and more over the years. Another man making Australia look like a joke.","749":"Lost my wife's bag. Said they needed to take it off so they could get more fuel onboard. They have no idea where it is and she is on a 2 month visit to see her family and friends. QANTAS you should be ashamed.","750":"I bought a Qantas ticket for myself and wife and son to fly from Melbourne to the gold coast and back on 07 April 2021 . This was a full fair ticket for $1152.36 and was made up of two components , the first was the Government 50% off incentive of $576.18 , and my share $576.18. It wasn't a Qantas discounted ticket. Then Victoria went into lockdown because of covid, and we were promised that we could defer the ticket to a later date . That was all very good , but Quantas became greedy and at the end of 2021 they decided without asking the consent of the ticket holder, changed the deferred ticket to a credit , breaking their original promises of deferment.\nQantas not only changed the ticket to a credit but decided to pocket the Govt tax payer rebate off $576.18 for themselves and only credited my $576.18. This is outright theft and steals from the taxpayer and consumer.\nI put a complaint in to Quantas and their reply by email was in short they were keeping the Govt rebate because they can and don't care that they are stealing from the taxpayer or the consumer.","751":"I have a problem with my Qantas club membership. Something that will take Qantas a few seconds to fix. I contacted them in December, I get an email every couple of months that they haven't forgotten me. Then when I try to call, I'm on hold for an hour only to be disconnected.\nLook, I understand that Qantas customer service has be slashed to the bone to subsidise Alan Joyce' obscene salary. But really Qantas? Surely things can't have deteriorated this much under his' stewardship'.","752":"There are no negative things that can be said about Qantas as an airline.\n\nService in all classes of the aircraft are exemplary.\n\nThe amount of professionalism from the crew both on the ground and in the air are exactly the same.\n\nCheck in is one of the friendliest and easiest in the business. But as Qantas are part of the Sun Alliance this is hardly surprising.\n\nWhether you are considering a long haul or internal flight within Australia, Qantas is the only airline worth considering.","753":"Qantas cancelled my flight from Melb - LA within 48 hours of take off. No reason given, in fact I didn\u2019t even receive a message of the changes from my Qantas app. Was put on a flight to Sydney the following day, then to head on to LA and Seattle. All the changes have me arriving almost a full day later. Many many of other passengers had the same experience. General consensus is that the Melb flight wasn\u2019t full enough to warrant the flight to LA. So two flights were combined at tremendous inconvenience the the Melbourne passengers. No sure how this is a fair way to treat clients with f the business. Very very disappointed in QANTAS. If they need to charge more to ensure flights run they that\u2019s what they should be doing, not having a potential hidden cost of losing a day of your time and plans ruined. Not fair. Communication was non existent. Phone call to Qantas was a waste of an hour. The guy couldn\u2019t say why it was cancelled (probably wasn\u2019t allowed to say why). Won\u2019t be flying Qantas again!","754":"I had an awful experience booking tickets with Qantas. I originally booked online, but had to make three calls and spend 11 hours on the phone with Qantas, including many hours on hold, before I received my tickets and itinerary.\n\nI booked my tickets online on Easter Monday (18 April 2022) and chose to pay with BPay, an electronic bill payment system in Australia. Immediately after making the booking, I arranged the payment through my internet banking. Since Easter Monday was a public holiday, my bank processed the payment on Tuesday, the next business day.\n\nHowever, I did not receive my tickets or itinerary, although I paid. I called on Friday night and the agent claimed that Qantas had not received my payment.\n\nAlthough I assured her that I could see in internet banking that the payment had been made, she suggested I call my bank to confirm that the payment had been made. My bank would not open for another 3 days, not until after the Anzac Day public holiday. I thought this was a bad solution.\n\nI asked if there was a way to resolve my matter that day.\n\nShe collected my credit card details, processed a payment and said I would receive my tickets and itinerary within 24-48 hours. Although I thought my problem had been resolved, it hadn't.\n\nFour days passed. During this time, I tried to get in touch with Qantas through Facebook, but there was no response.\n\nI made a second call on Tuesday. I explained what happened to a different agent. I think his name was John. I didn\u2019t think he was very helpful because I had to explain myself repeatedly. He said that he needed to talk to the ticketing department and would call me back ASAP and would not address any other calls in the meantime.\n\nBut he never called back, even after three hours.\n\nSo, I called Qantas again and after 3 hours on hold, I explained the situation for a third time.\n\nI asked if there were any records of the previous two calls.\n\nThe new agent, Lisa, said that although the previous two agents should have taken notes of everything in the conversations, there were no notes. The only note was one saying that my tickets were cancelled because payment was not received.\n\nAfter being on hold for a further hour or so, presumably so Lisa could look into the matter, she collected the BPay reference number of the payment and was able to send the tickets and itinerary after a further short wait.\n\nAlthough my matter was ultimately resolved, I'm unimpressed with the disorderly and inconsistent treatment that I received during the process and how many hours I spent before it was resolved. What was supposed to be a happy time, looking forward to my trip, was anxious for me because of the many days it took to resolve the matter and the broken promises of the first two agents.","755":"The entertainment is not what it used to be. There is no longer a comedy or an easy listening channel. Inexplicably on the classics channel there was not one but four CDs by pianist Lang Lang. The overall choice was poor. Ambient music barely gets a look-in.","756":"Shocking seats first ones in premium economy years ago. Wanted an upgrade to pay- qantas would not talk to me saying it is a BA flight, Ba wont talk saying it is a Qantas booking- sometimes held on for 2 hours then disconnected- disgusting unhelpful airline, cannot be contacted- someone should do something about Qantas our national airline","757":"Where do I start? Travelled with the Worst airline on the planet from Melbourne to Arizona return, outward bound the flight was 4 hours late taking off, at least 2 of those hours sitting on the tarmac. Subsequently arrived way late and missed my connection. Connection desk, if you can call it that, in LAX was near on useless and moved me to a United flight, instead of AA that I was flying and they fly out of Terminal 7 some hours later again. Where does Qantas & AA depart from, you guessed it Terminal 1, the other end of the airport! Enjoying Arizona, I was informed at the very last moment that my return flight direct to Melbourne from LAX had been cancelled and I was being moved to flights LAX-Syd-Melb, at a time\/ day not convenient for me, fancy that. After waiting quite sometime on the phone, I moved my flights to a day later to accommodate business meetings, but had to fly via Dallas-Syd-Melb. Can't remember which poor Chef has his\/ her name attached to their inflight menu, but I'd suggest giving back what ever they're paying you and backing away slowly. The Phoenix hamburger store 'Chuckbox' offers way better fare for much less! As usual nothing in Qantas' schedule runs on time and combine delays with a Qantas tech issue where many passengers APIS forms were not relayed on to border control, resulting in many passengers, including Moi, not being allowed to use the fast digital passport machine\/ queue. Waited in the longest snake queue for passport control and yes, missed my 8AM connecting flight to Melbourne. Wandered down to the connection desk, who to their credit look tired and worn out from handling managements ineptitudes, waited in another long snake Q, only to be bumped to a 4PM flight, yes, you read correct 4PM, 8 hours later. If you include the flight time, I could've cancelled my connecting flight, hired a car and driven home faster.","758":"Flight was delayed without communication or explanation but not significantly.\n\nFood was shockingly bad. We had \u2018chilli con carne\u2019 served with potatoes. But for the air hostess telling us what is was, we would not have known. It was a brown-red slop which tasted as bad as it looked. Other than a main (the other option was chicken salad), the only other food was 1x Lindor chocolate ball. No cheese and biscuits for a 5 hour flight. No bottled water offered.\n\nThe iPad and table were not clean- suggest you bring your own wipes. It surprises me hygiene was not paramount given COVID. Qantas needs to get the basics right, especially health and safety related.","759":"We had an underwhelming long haul experience with Qantas and then took this final domestic flight home. What a nice surprise! The purser Paul was lovely and we enjoyed a delicious Croque Monsieur for an early lunch. The 717 has a nice small business cabin and we used the streaming service to watch a movie.","760":"This was the final domestic leg of our long flight from London. The meal service was again unsophisticated and they ran out of black tea and china cups... in business class?","761":"This 787 flight QF2 is supposed to be a Qantas flagship flight. We were already disappointed with Qantas's poor customer service on the phone - we were messed about with involuntary changes to our flights that we could not deal with online so had to be on hold for hours.\n\nThe check in was fine and we liked the fast track security. The London lounge is very disappointing - very average food and only a few seats with a view.\n\nI found the seat to be very comfortable and got 9 hours sleep but partner could not get it to adjust to a comfy position.\n\nThe food tasted OK but was very unsophisticated. Compared to Emirates business class this was like McDonalds versus a Michelin restaurant!\n\nWe were most upset by the poor attention to service - the forward toilet had no water in the tap which we were advised was an ongoing issue with this plane (the 787 logo jet with the Qantas logos through the years) and no amenity kits were loaded. They also ran out of waters and had no icecream. Yep first world problems but the airfares are very much first world!\n\nThe purser was very helpful and pleasant and was trying to explain away the issues but we are not flying this route again on Qantas.","762":"In October 2021, Return flights booked Sydney to Durban South Africa for March 2022. Single booking with connecting flights In December 2021 Qantas with no reference to me, changed my flight Johannesburg to Sydney to a day later than originally booked. This meant I was now going to be on a layover in Johannesburg for 28 hours. Calls 5 in total, to Qantas call centre based in South Africa, told me that a hotel would be provided in Johannesburg. When I arrived in Johannesburg no hotel had been arranged resulting in me having to arrange my own budget accommodation. Qantas has so far ignored my requests for reimbursement. Qantas has no regard for its fare paying passengers.","763":"Qantas is an absolute joke. Airplane filthy and broken. Worst international carrier. Makes air India look a treat. I was served a meal in a box like mc donalds on a $2k flight. Seat was covered in chewing gum. Horrible. I had to tape it myself.","764":"Booked return flights from Perth to Uk, qantas processed payment successfully however four days later they took another full payment for these fares and to date have not received a refund for second transaction.\n\nSpent over 4 hours on hold trying to sort out, was told that it can\u2019t be returned as it\u2019s pending. My bank can\u2019t return the money either so for a $3,400 fare for two return flights, qantas have had the best part of $7000 from us. My card has been declined because I had no idea they were taking the second transaction resulting in me being overdrawn. This is absolutely appalling and I would never book flights or fly qantas nor would I recommend anyone to book with them.\n\nWhen I asked for a phone number to ring someone in Australia I was told there isn\u2019t one and to ring back on the same number which would mean being on hold for another few hours just to get the same useless customer service.","765":"Do yourself a favour and do everything within your power to avoid this airline. It is near impossible to get in contact with them, and on more than one occasion I have found myself hung up on after being stuck on hold for 3 hours.\n\nIt is not possible to redeem flight credit via their website - instead you are forced to phone them. It also takes them an inordinate amount of time to get anything done, and they blatantly lie to customers. Awful, disgusting and amoral airline. Fly with absolutely anyone else, and pay any amount of money just to avoid Qantas.","766":"Flight got cancelled and we were pushed to a flight that was meant to depart at 10.30 am to a flight that would depart at 12 noon which was acceptable.\n\nThen we were told flight would be delayed till 4 and then to 4.30 and eventually to 5.50pm. When we spoke to. the cabin crew they were quick to brush it off as a slight delay!\n\nWhat ridiculous service!\n\nNever taking QANTAS again!\n\nThere is no one for you to reach out to about their service. You are put on 3 to 4 hours wait list to get through to customer service. Even then it is not promised you might get them.","767":"Departed Hobart approx. 40 minutes behind schedule but only 10 minutes late arriving in Perth thanks to a strong tail wind. Great old fashioned service at check-in, friendly and helpful, and allocated seats 16C & 16B. Doubt if there was an empty seat on the flight and a 15 min. wait for anyone requiring the chicken meal, luckily I enjoy pork meals. The Penfolds Koonunga Hill shiraz cabernet enjoyed. Entertainment seemed to have improved or perhaps I had overlooked something on the flight over, in any event I enjoyed a couple of movies. Disembarkation fairly quick . Cabin crew friendly and helpful throughout and good commentary from the cockpit.","768":"After many cancellations due to Covid restrictions in Tasmania and particularly WA, seven flight changes, 2 by Qantas and the other 5 by restrictions, we arrived at the airport to be greeted by a friendly and helpful Qantas staff member who proceeded to check us in, print our boarding passes and baggage identifiers. Our flight departed on schedule, passengers well spaced and we could relax for the duration. Enjoyed our light meals, accompanying wine, etc. Seated in 18B & 18C, my wife moved to 18A which afforded both pf us extra room and comfort. Entertainment was poor.","769":"Poor service. We booked Qantas from Queensland to NZ only to have our flight cancelled and be told we were rebooked on JetStar. No apology, no explanation and no compensation for the much lower standard of service at check in and on the plane. We won't be flying Qantas again if there is a risk of being dumped on to JetStar.\nAlso when I tried to contact Qantas they never replied.","770":"I have been on a family holiday to Hawaii and it is great to be back traveling again but I have to say Qantas service has declined significantly since I last traveled overseas. My flight over was painful enough with delays due to baggage issues, but that is just part of travel at the moment.\n\nFirstly The flight crew were not their normal friendly selves to the point that I had my call attendant button lit up for a good 10 min before I finally saw an attendant walking past and I managed to get their attention.\n\nI am now about to fly home and have woken up to changes in the itinerary my flight has been pushed back from a 10:55am to 1:05pm and I understand that this happens where the problem starts is that now i don\u2019t connect with my qantas flight from Sydney to Melbourne. I have been told that there no flights in the evening between Sydney and Melbourne to get me home. So summary is delayed flight no connection at the other end so an overnight in Sydney before a 6:00am flight to Melbourne and when I asked about being put up in accommodation was told \u201cno we can\u2019t do that\u201d. So the expectations is that I will fund my own accommodation or relax in the lounge. What a joke.\n\nI was a platinum frequent flyer and over the last few years with a change in role I have dropped back to gold so maybe my expectations were set too high, but with the service received on the plane and the service through qantas customer service, my experience has been really poor. Obviously focused on moving people and not about people them selves.","771":"Appalling customer service. Booked a RT flight from Adelaide AUS to Nelson NZ to see family for the first time since COVID.\nJust received an email with a flight change from Qantas for our return flight but they've completely forgotten that we are departing from Nelson NZ- Auckland arriving at 2pm, and booked our departing flight out of Auckland at 6am the same morning. How on earth do we get on a flight that departs Auckland 8 hours before we even arrive from Nelson? Now on hold for 2 hours, no assistance provided. Last time that I book with Qantas.","772":"ANOTHER FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER.\n\nWe have spent anything between 10-15 hrs over the last 3 days trying to talk to someone after QANTAS changed our flights, effectively rendering our connection flights with other airlines useless.\n\nDo not know if we will be able to fly.\nWe do need to flight, but cannot do anything online as our cancelled flight credits do not show anywhere. No idea where our money has gone.\n\nIt seems Qantas phone line is designed to make you quit trying. I tried several numbers without success. Hours waiting, going no where; getting no answers.","773":"the worst customer service I have ever experienced, and the guy who just hang up after on me waiting for 3hrs that's really poor form\neveryone is experiencing challenges but you are more concerned with profits that people and guess what that catches up to every business","774":"To start with, no water, you have to ask for it. No pilllows or blankets. When asked for blanket crew said sorry we no longer keep blankets. There is no whiskey on drinks. Food was pathetic too. I beleive it was the same as economy class food. Usually other airlines have atleast 3course meal on business class. Airnz premium economy is 100% better then qantas business class. Seating also very uncomfortable.","775":"A premium Qantas member, I wonder why I support them\n\n834585601\n\nMy partners flight was cancelled on the 10th.4 hours before her flight.\nNo notice. No offer of accommodation, nothing.\nShe didn't want to fly the rescheduled day due to the time it was arriving into London.\nSpent time with 3 phone calls to Qantas. Total hours 5.5 hours with not being able to speak with them.\nTo to go into their portal to manage my flight they blocked the portal.\n\n25 years I have been a member with them.\nThey have no loyalty.\nI am a premium member of Frequent flyer. So I show my loyalty.\nNo more!\nI will travel with a One world airline to keep my status, I will never travel with this arrogant airline again.\nThey treat customers in an appalling way.\n\nI have had so many issues over the journey being a customer of Qantas.\n\nEnough is enough.\nWe Australlians should boycott this company until it treats its customers in a better way and with some kind of respect.\nThey demand, it in there phone recording","776":"On the day of departure, Qantas sent a text that the flight has been delayed by 1 day. No offer of accommodation, dinner, breakfast, transfers, nor explanation why its been delayed. Very poor service. Business class seats were just like premium economy and not like those advertised. If it was JetStar I would understand, but not Qantas. Qantas doesn't even reply to Facebook comments. Also they forgot my wife's gluten free meal as well due to the delay. Just hopeless.","777":"Travelled to Noumea from Melbourne with connecting flight in Sydney . Only one suitcase arrived in New Caledonia . Qantas staff sent suitcase to Fiji instead and then returned it to Sydney with all my wife's clothes cosmetics and medication . They kept it at Sydney although they knew we were looking for it After numerous attempts to contact the rude staff of Qantas regarding the missing suitcase via phone and email all we got was a automated response telling us they would get back to us when they could . Great help when you are in a foreign country with nothing . They also told me at the airport that they could not be bothered contacting us or forwarding the bag to us . If possible do not fly with Qantas . Staff are rude and for some unjustified reason' arrogant ! Also they are not capable to answer any queries as they are ignorant of any policies and work practices . You think a firm like Qantas would proved some rudimentary training or induction before they set them off to work . I doubt they will respond to this review with a level of maturity fitting for a responsible and accountable organisation . Actually I doubt they are educated enough to write , after all you probably need a grade 4 education which I doubt they possess .","778":"As a global traveller for over 25 years, I've got to say travelling from LA to Melbourne with Qantas on QF12 and QF427 respectively on the 15th April and 17th April has been an absolute nightmare!!\nHere's why:\nQF12 -\n1. Qantas cancelled our flight 2 days prior to our flight time via text without any clue when our next flight would be.\n2. 24 hours before our next flight we find our that the direct flight (which we paid extra for) has been re-routed via Sydney and has now added an additional 4 hours onto our initial 24 hour trip.\n3. On the LA flight (QF12), there was one incredibly rude blonde staff member who clearly did not want to work or help anyone. After asking her for help to put a bag up in the overheard compartment she responds with \"You'll just have to put it under your legs\". This was when there was plenty of room available in overheard compartments as well, i just needed some help to reach up to it. For a 15 hour flight in business class, no I do not want to have anything near my legs and be comfortable. This was the worst inflight service I have experienced in my 25 years of travelling with Qantas.\n4. When we asked for a cheese plate that same blonde staff member (didn't catch her name but she was serving the business class passengers in the top deck) said \"I have put those away and not sure if we have any left anyways\". After asking her to check if there was any left, she comes back and quietly puts the plate down and walks off.\n\nQF 427:\n5. On arrival in Sydney we were redirected to a Qantas check-in counter to recheckin our bags could have been fine had their been enough staff, however just 4 counters were open after an A380 flight carrying more than 400 people had just landed plus additional traffic who had arrived from other Qantas flights.\n6. On top of all this, it appears Qantas doesn't care whether you pay an 20K extra for a business class seat because business and economy were all waiting in the same queue at the Qantas transfer desk. There wasn't a business class queue. This also continued with the transfer business as Qantas jam-packed the buses with economy, business, families with crying babies and whatnot all on the one bus, unlike other airlines who separate the two classes for customer convenience.\n7. On arrival at the Qantas domestic terminal, there were two queues for the security scans one for business and one for economy. However, a bunch of families and other passengers had blantantly walked into the business class queue and Qantas had no security personnel or staff member checking anyone's boarding passes meaning there was really no difference again with paying for a business class flight and travelling cattle class.\n8. It is also noteworthy to mention that because of the understaffed Qantas counters at the transfer desk in the Sunday international terminal the line behind us had about 300+ people coming through and many were about to or had already missed their connecting flight to Melbourne as Qantas had only opened a select number of desks.\n9. The rude attitude of the majority of the Qantas staff just added to the chaos in the Sydney airport.\n10. Prior to boarding the flight from Melbourne to Sydney, one Qantas blonde staff member who was scanning tickets at Gate 1 of Sydney's domestic airport pulled us aside from the business class queue saying we had too many bags. Mind you we had 2 bags each and 1 laptop bag, which as per Qantas policy is allowed for business class passengers. We explained this to the lady at the counter who aggressively responded with \"I don't care who you are and where you're travelling from, you can't take all those bags onboard\". Mind you there were other passengers with the same number of bags who had just walked past. So not sure if the lady was just racist? We also explained to her that we had just got off a Qantas flight on which we had carried the exact same amount of bags with no issue. We also told her that Qantas was the one who cancelled our flight and put us on this one, had we had gone directly to Melbourne this wouldn't have been an issue. The rude staff member just responded with which bag are you checking in because you're not taking them all on board. I was utterly shocked with the service and attitude of both the blonde staff members on both flights in the last 24 hours.\n\nThis was THE worst experience in my whole 25 years of travelling with Qantas. To top it off the breakfast tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.\n\nOverall view: Will not be travelling on Qantas anytime in the near future until the incompetent staff are replaced. The worst staff and service ever and terrible food was just the cherry on top.","779":"It saddens me to say this but every experience I have had with Qantas since January has been bad. On a domestic from SYD-BNE they cancelled the flight 45 minutes before departure without explanation. We were handed a $15 food voucher and put on a flight 5 hrs later. Coming back to SYD I had booked a flight for 2pm, then in the days leading up to departure it was pushed back to 3pm, 4pm, 5pm, until finally they settled on 6pm for the service that actually flew. That gave me less time to connect to my international flight to LAX, and when I got there I saw that they had without warning changed the scheduled 787-9 aircraft to an A380. No complaint there, right? Except that the In Flight Entertainment on that 14 hour flight was not working across the entire aircraft. It really feels like amateur hour at Qantas these days, especially when I compare these shenanigans to the efficient service I have experienced domestically in the US on American and Delta, supposedly inferior airlines which nonetheless manage to provide the services they offer, on time, and who manage tight-connections efficiently with no loss of baggage. Qantas has a much smaller and easier network to manage, they have had all of the pandemic to prepare for full service, and they are failing miserably so far. I truly hope this once great airline gets its act together soon, to repair the damage to its reputation.","780":"Qantas has turned my first trip to America into a nightmare\nMy travel agents booked me On QF 7 to Dallas\n\nThis was delayed (by 6hrs !!!) so I missed my next flight to Jacksonville with American Airlines\n\nUpon arrival in Dallas I was not given the next flight to JAX and had to stay overnight in hotel that was apparently \u201cbooked\u201d for us, and only knew this once you turned up at the hotel.\n\nTo make things worse my wallet was stolen on the plane and upon finding out staff were alerted but did nothing to reassure, they proceeded to look through my stuff with a torch and question my integrity.\n\nSo after experiencing a stressful and upsetting time on the plane I was given no transfers for airport to the Sheraton with the apparent \u201cbooked room\u201d and no staff to talk to\n\nI was then routed on United Arline (which wasn\u2019t what was on the ticket originally) to Houston then to JAX . United airlines is not one world carrier even\n\nJust now that flight is delayed and I was rudely told to get on the next plane to Chicago then another to JAX\nUA people said QF did this\nWhat a nightmare\n\nMy travel agents called the agent help line which no one answers as it is a public holiday and are closed was the recording\n\nQF is faceless and can not ever talk to anyone\nEven our consolidator spent 3 hours on the QF agent help line number before they were answered\n\nThe CEO , Exec team and Board must not care about customer service at all so far removed from reality\n\nI lived a travel nightmare, and will never fly them again!\nThanks QANTAS Not","781":"Qantas took double amount for flights, rang them and the customer service level is rude and withholding. She refused to look into what happened so had to call again but merged the call so she could hear what real customer service is. The second lady, straight onto my case on the reasoning why and forwarded me to the finance department. While the first lady still on the call listening.","782":"Firstly, the flight was full which is great news for the Australian aviation industry. Our flight departed and arrived on time, there were no dramas with luggage and boarding and getting off the aircraft all occurred with a minimum of fuss. Now for a couple of things to bear in mind before flying with Qantas. On this flight there was no in-flight entertainment, but free wi-fi was available (which I used to pass the time). A snack was offered (a small packet of biscuits) and a beverage, but no one is getting fat flying on Qantas! Cabin staff were professional and interactions with the staff were appropriate for such a short flight. Look ... Qantas supplied a service that was professional and reasonably priced, nothing to rave about but OK.","783":"Cancelled direct flight from Canberra to Cairns. Offered a flight 1000km away leaving Brisbane including a four hour stopover. No inflight entertainment, food was rubbish. Attempted to contact Qantas, 2.5 hr wait first time then hung up. When finally getting through after some 6 hrs, didn't know which flights available. Boarded flight eventually when advised flight plan wasn't provided to Airservices waiting on the tarmac for almost 2 hrs with excuse that Airservices had network problems (no redundancy?). On return again flight delayed by over 1.5 hrs. Again no inflight services and crap food. The worst airline be a long shot that I've ever had the misfortune to fly. A total disgrace. Fly Virgin.","784":"6 weeks after the 4 tickets were purchased, Qantas sent an email informing us that our original flight was cancelled.\nThe website wouldn't allow us to change the flight date to any other day if the same week even though flights were available, leaving only the option to cancel and take a credit. THIS IS A TRICK!!!!... Once you click cancel, from a consumer Law perspective it was YOU who cancelled the booking, at which point Qantas have no further obligation to fly you at the original fair. The ticket prices had gone up 30%, and what Qantas we're trying is to get more money.\nThe Australian customer service line (13 13 13) is a joke, and no calls get answered in under two hours. When I was finally front of the phone queue, the operator simply hung up! They avoid providing an Australian customer service email address for the same reason... To ensure that your only reasonable option is to take a credit on the website, and then rebook at a much higher price.\n\nWe will definately NEVER fly Qantas again if this is how they treat paying customers. Alan Joyce needs to be removed... this nonsense is simply unethical!","785":"Further to my review of 11 April 2022, Qantas has refunded me in full 3 business days after NSW Fair Trading contacted them regarding my claim. Thank you to NSW Fair Trading and brickbats to Qantas. You have just lost 2 customers with 50 combined years of flying with your airline..","786":"We flew yesterday with Qantas,what a disappointment! They separated at least three couples for what seemed to be no particular reason. My husband is a large man and was placed next to two separate travelers who were large. He had a sore chest from being squashed. I was placed near a man travelling by himself. Another lady need to be next to her husband as he needs assistance. Another lady who is quite nervous was separated from her partner. So we certainly didn\u2019t enjoy our trip.","787":"Qantas has twice acknowledged that it owes me $1600. Unfortunately they have spent the past 8 months either lying about when the refund will be paid or ignoring me. The Airline Customer Advocate (ACA) is useless as they have a special Covid Notice in place saying they won't deal with refund issues. The ACCC doesn't deal with individual claims, but are happy to take your complaints and may take action if the volume is large. But finally some action....with NSW Fair Trading. Firstly, I sent a Letter of Demand to Qantas as per the Fair Trading website proforma. After no response (surprise!!) I raised a complaint. It took NSW Fair Trading a couple of weeks to take on my refund issue, but once this happened Qantas was given 5 days to respond to me. Qantas emailed me 2 days later! I have the option to escalate the complaint with NSW Fair Trading if I don't have the money in 3 more days. Please everyone in NSW, contact NSW Fair Trading...they answer their phones straight away and they do want to help","788":"After spending over 4 hours on the phone to customer service, we received information that my flight was automatically changed due to the flight beong cancelled. I knew this was not the case since my friends were still on the flight and seats were still being sold live. Took 3 calls to get customer service to investigate further and reissue ticket on original flight.\n\nI was very very very disappointed for a long time fan of the flying kangaroo.","789":"While a long line of passengers waited to check in there were only three agents at open windows. At the same time, four qantas employees were chatting near the entry point to the line. In addition, four more employees were clustered behind the counter and were deep in their own conversation. Let\u2019s hope they figured out where they are going to eat after work. I am a senior citizen with four prosthetic joints, which undoubtedly adds to my annoyance. The Aussie accents are charming but I\u2019d rather they just did their jobs.","790":"The video and WiFi did not work at any point on my 10.5 hour flight. The flight attendants were fine, but the airline\u2019s technological ineptitude makes me wonder about their safety. A cute Aussie accent doesn\u2019t make up for the rest of it.","791":"Absolutely shocking! Qantas cancelled my flight and rescheduled for the following day then decided to split my family up and put two of us on Qantas and the rest on jetstar. They lack communication and it's extremely difficult to get a hold of them.\n\nDo not travel with them especially if you're booking family flights.","792":"Here is an email that explains why you should not trust or use Qantas. Stephanie Tully is a top dog in Qantas who's name appears in their group apology emails.\n\nHi Stephanie,\n\nThanks for the recent email trying to explain the woeful phone service we've been putting up with.\nOur first flight was cancelled so we put up with a lesser quality service to get to Cairns. Due to the flight change we couldn't change our return date online (not allowed).\nWe spent 4 hours plus of our holiday on hold to Qantas to change our return flight to jetstar 8.00am tomorrow. REF xxxxx\nTonight we received news that our flight tomorrow has been cancelled. We stupidly wasted an hour on hold to jetstar knowing they couldn't help us with a Qantas flight as all of there's were 15 hours plus ordeals (Darwin is a 2.15 flight direct) and they have no access to Qantas systems apparently.\nI'm currently 2 hours 30 minutes into a call with Qantas to hopefully get home tomorrow....\nIf you wonder why people get p'd off then here is a great example.\nCan you get us home and refund the dinner my wife and I spent listening to Qantas annoying hold music and propaganda?\nI will be avoiding flying for the next 12 months at least and hopefully in that time some decent competition emerges so we don't get messed around again by Qantas.\nDo better or go out of business, I don't care about Qantas at all. And please stop wasting money on TV ads, they are sickening and jingoistic. Its sad you can't answer a phone call in 4 hours.\nNot impressed\n\nPaul","793":"Not only have I paid twice, twice (so that\u2019s 4 times for 2 flights), this week, I stood at the carousel for an hour waiting, it\u2019s not like they were busy because NOBODIES luggage came out.\n\nIf I remember correctly Qantas was paid by the Australian Government to keep the service running so there wouldn\u2019t be a problem when pandemic restrictions were lifted. Clearly Qantas collected our tax dollar with no intention of maintaining an acceptable level of service.\n\nI have always preferred to fly Qantas because the service was better and if plans changed they made it easy to change.\n\nAfter listening to the CEO.blame customers for the debarked at Sydney airport, will he take any responsibility for the double fare rip off and hour long waits for baggage. Is there a way he can blame customers for this? Probably.","794":"Zero customer care. Total arrogance from Alan Joyce towards his customers. Disgusting company, do not fly","795":"Qantas customer service is very bad. Stuck in Sydney overnight, no hotel even when assured in Hawaii I'll be taken care of. For your peace of mind, don't fly Qantas!","796":"Booked with Qantas and paid for our trip. Got confirmation from Qantas. Emails from them a few days later wanting to change a flight time and they needed our agreement......when we tried to agree they wanted the flight paid for again. Tried the enquiry number 2 hour wait....tired late at night....2 hour wait....tried early in the morning...2 hour wait. Went to Qantas office in Brisbane...they had closed it and moved. Went to Brisbane Airport...they have closed the Qantas Domestic travel enquiry desk. Spoke to International Desk...very helpful...handed me a phone!!! 10 minute wait turned into an hour with other domestic passengers now waiting also. Asked for manager...she turned up gave her my receipt for the payment details and she went away...came back and said I should wait on the phone....asked to speak to her manager...her response? Alan Joyce!!! challenged this and she admitted her supervisor was not on site. She went back to her office for another go and suddenly the phone answered. Explained the problem and Qantas rep admitted all their fault and they did not have the money our bank said they had. Suggested we pay again....we indicated that we would do so but if our bank confirmed we had paid twice for the same tickets to Qantas we were off to the Qld Police.....Qantas rep virtually hung up in my ear but I convincer her to chat to the next passenger and she agreed but after I handed him the phone Qantas rep hung up in his ear!!!\nBack to Westpac....very helpful...stated Qantas had our money & if it wasn't refunded within a week Westpac would lay a complaint with Qantas and recall our funds....conveyed all this to Qantas including Alan Joyce...a week later no response to the emails...back to Westpac...still very helpful. They laid the complaint and recalled the funds from Qantas. Rebooked through Virgin.","797":"I have been on hold for over 4 hrs and still no light at the end of tunnel. So frustrating that Australia\u2019s major airline has such appalling service. How are people supposed to get any service if this is what we have to put up with.","798":"I got my flights to Japan on special. All seemed well. Got my ticket. A little over a month before departure, they cancelled one of my flights and converted my entire trip to flight credit.\n\nThe flight credit page didn't let me book the flights I needed. I could fly to Christchurch to Tokyo or Sydney to Osaka but not Christchurch to Osaka. So I called them, waited nearly 4 hours before the representative answered and rebooked me with a $119 fare difference charge. I was billed but never got a receipt for my payment and never received a ticket.\n\nI've since called them another 3 times, all a few days apart from each other, asking for my tickets. Each time the wait has been around 4 hours or more. Each time they've told me that my tickets would get emailed to me and each time they haven't. I have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to make plans in Japan cause I'm not sure that I can fly there.\n\nNever book QANTAS. Their wait times for calls are awful, no call-back service offered, and I've paid nearly 1.5k for nothing.","799":"1 week prior to my flight, I made umpteen attempts to purchase extra baggage online....with no success. I tried calling the Qantas helpline and after call wait time of 31\/2 hours the operator told me that this can only be done online. I explained that I repeatedly got an error message (error code 37371). I further tried consulting with a Qantas representative at the airport a day before my flight and she told me to continue trying to make this payment online and if I didn't win ,I will have to pay the full cost of extra Baggage upon check-in. I feel most disconcerted by this poor customer service and never will I book a flight through Qantas again.","800":"I have been trying to get in touch with Qantas for the last 3 days to cancel a flight that departed 3 days ago! I need to rebook for this weekend and my family has been trying to contact Qantas in Germany and myself in Australia! The last 3 days we have been on hold multiple times just being advised that the wait time is over 2 hours. We don\u2019t actually know how long to wait for and how many people are in front. I spent just under 400.000 Qantas points plus 1500 Australian cash on this booking and won\u2019t rebook a new flight out of pocket for another 3.5k Australian!! It\u2019s just not on. It\u2019s absolutely horrendous this is my first reward booking and experience with Qantas. I know everyone is understaffed but you don\u2019t need to take more flights on that you can actually handle! We also called emirates rigid week and they picked up there phone\u2026.\nI have also sent an email and tried to contact via Facebook messenger. On top of this whole non communication disaster it puts my family through hell. My parents are elderly struggling from Alzheimer, diabetes and a heart condition\u2026 preparing for a flight for Sunday which might not happen a nightmare! Not happy, Qantas never again!","801":"We\u2019ve been on and off the phone with qantas for WEEKS. Each call had a waiting time of 4-7 hours\u2026 yes SEVEN! In more than one occasion, someone would pick up and literally hang up the phone. In MAJORITY of them, we would be out on hold while customer service \u201ctalks to the manager\u201d and the call would just cut and we\u2019d have to queue again for another 4-7 hours. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nMajority of the customer service staff have no idea what they\u2019re doing. They can\u2019t do the most basic task. I don\u2019t know why the Qantas app or website cannot simply allow their passengers to change their flights online like every other airline but they force us to call their customer service team to do it for us and they can barely do it.\n\nMy husband needed his flight changed from the 3rd of April to the 16th and it literally took 5 tries. 5 different customer service representative and 5 times of us queuing for 4-7 hours cos each of them can\u2019t do their job. Each one will say they will call us back when they hear back from another team and literally NONE OF THEM CALL BACK. They say the change is confirmed but we have NOT received any e-ticket or any form of anything confirming the change.\n\nWe are talking to the 6th representative as I type this and she\u2019s telling us that there was actually an error and the tickets were never sorted. She trying to fix it now but I honestly have no confidence that it will be sorted and we\u2019ll just have to cancel the ticket\n\nThe other issue is they had a promotion running on the 18th of March where if you bought points, they would add a bonus of 50%. We were meant to get 75,000 points in total but instead, our money was just taken and no points were given.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried sorting this out with qantas each time we talked to them and we\u2019ve sent photo proof of the purchase to the email they requested and we have a reference number and everything. 5 people have promised to give us a call back to inform us about what happened with our points and not a single one of them have called back.\n\nAbsolutely atrocious service. Never fly with this airline.","802":"I don't think anyone from Qantas actually reads these reviews but they certainly should. Because their reputation is crashing. I spent hours trying to reach someone in customer service and then once someone finally answered my phone the experience was horrible. They tried to lie to me telling me I can't use my credit for international flight, although it clearly states in the flight conditions that I can - if I call them. Then they said I can only use half of my credit for international flight... Seriously?! And the last one was I can't combine credit with my Qantas pass... This is my money I already spent with you Qantas and I just simply want to use it. It's wrong to hope that most people will just give up and you will collect all their credits. Shame on you!","803":"Qantas annot be contacted, with no capability to contact via email\/chat. The call centre took 4 hours to answer, only to advise to wait another day for a BPAY payment to be processed and flights confirmed, after already waiting for 4 days. After waiting, payment still failed to process, with the only option to resove the issue, to call back and wait another 4 hours on hold.\nQantas did not respond to a messenger chat sent 4 days earlier.\nCompletely unacceptable customer service from a major airline.\nI called a competing airline regarding a return flight with the phone answered within 2 minutes.","804":"No help, no support, What a joke the \"National Carrier\" has become. Was on hold for 4 hours after they changed my flight from Hobart to Brisbane (from arriving early afternoon to late evening! ) Then changed it to later agian , was on hold for 34 hours, finally someone answered, they took my booking number, put me on hold for 15 minutes then disconnected my call. Qantas - As per your survey at the end , 1 for Customer Satisfaction, 1 for ease of service and no my request was handled successfully .","805":"Flight route (Via Darwin): The flight route was great - a 4hour flight to darwin followed by a 17hour flight to London is much easier than flying via other cities such as Dubai, Bangkok or Singapore as you transit through just Australia = no additional security\/covid tests\n\nLounge Access: They let us use the first class lounge due to not enough travellers to use both lounges which was amazing.\n\nSeats\/Suites: The suites are spacious and have great amenities (including massage functionality!) The pyjamas were a nice touch too. The amenity bags were a bit lacklustre for how much you pay for the ticket - also on my flight they ran out of amenity bags and did not receive one. I couldn't even get a spare one from economy - which made sleeping without an eyemask pretty awful.\n\nFood: The food in both the lounges and on board was amazing, fresh and presented beautifully. I wish they had given us proper salt & pepper shakers, the salt packets I had on the return leg were soggy, even the replacement one was too. Also, the cutlery is awkward and strangely designed.\n\nAll up, Qantas Business Class is a great experience, however, it does not compare to other airlines like Ethihad which feel a lot more luxurious.","806":"I would never recommend this airline.\nAbsolute nightmare. Complete disregard for pasngees, their needs.","807":"To redeem the credit for cancelled flights spent 6 hours on hold waiting for the operator - no luck. The site claims you can do it online which is a lie. All the giving credit thing is a scam to steal money of people supporting them during pandemic. Outrageous!","808":"Not exactly sure where to start, however they are the biggest rip off merchants, horrible call wait times, hours trying to rebook a very simple flight. Alan Joyce get you're a joke of a CEO - you couldn't run lemonade stand let alone an airline. Idiot!","809":"I recently made a booking with Qantas to fly from Rockhampton to Perth.\nMy dreadful experience extends from attempting to changes to my flight booking dates, to extra baggage request. I have acquired flight points that I am not able to use in a situation where this option is made available. I was not able (after umpteen attempts online)to purchase extra baggage before my flight at the reduced rate and was henceforth forced to pay the full rate at the time of checking in. What is the point of booking direct with Qantas? What is the value of accruing frequent flyer points? Qantas is a \"Brand\" that should value customers and provide the services they deserve. I am one very disappointed, dissatisfied regular Qantas traveller and my loyalty\/trust (as a result of my experiences) towards Qantas is NIL.","810":"Flight from Canberra to Melbourne takes less than an hour, Qantas flight delayed for almost 2 hours in Canberra on Friday night. Not even being sorry about that.. seems it's getting normal in #Qantas Australia.. WTH\ud83d\ude21 even no care passengers health at all.. but if we have like 0.5kgr over weight bag to check in,.....","811":"Qantas is one of the best airlines in the world, and we like to fly a lot on it.\n\nBut their Customer Service is one of the worst in the world.\n\nI have been on the phone for hours trying to get answers for a flight change without success. Even their personnel at the the airport Adelaide and Sydney cannot answer your questions\nIn talking to Qantas staff; their main complaint is their CEO and Chief Customer Service Officer were previously employed by Ryan Air and bring their world habits and practices with them.\nThey have closed their Customer Service centers in Australia and have transferred them to South Africa and Philippines and their service reputation has plummeted with them.\nNeed new top management","812":"I used to love Qantas. Now I hate it. Hours and hours on the phone to fix the issues they themselves create..... and that's if you are one of the lucky few who ever get your calls answered. God help those poor passengers who are being messed around by all the cancellations at the last minute etc. My issue was merely trying to have Qantas send me the necessary information about a flight credit they owed me from a cancelled flight last year (they'd apparently sent the email to an email address I had 20 years ago, and which I have updated with them at least three times over the past two years). Funnily I seem to get 4 emails a day from them about things I never asked to receive (Qantas Frequent Flyers, Qantas Wine, Qantas travel, Qantas Rewards etc. etc.) BUT nothing useful like my flight credit!\n\nSo 3 calls and 6 hours on hold - keeping myself occupied by reading through various review sites about the disgraceful way Qantas is now treating all their customers, left me feeling very sad. How a once-great airline can be reduced to something I would expect from a third-world carrier in just a few short years is appalling. Other airlines (many of which DIDN'T get the massive splash of cash that Qantas got from Australian taxpayers to keep things going during Covid) have managed to still put customers first by at least having the necessary staff to keep people informed and respected.\nSo why not Qantas? Clearly their executives are looking after no-one but themselves.\n\nI'm sure if absolutely nothing goes wrong (or if you have a priority rating which gets you direct access to staff who will help you), then things will be fine. No doubt bulk-bookers, frequent business high flyers and government types who have agents to do all their bookings have special ways to get assistance where required. But for the average mug traveller thinking that Qantas is still a reputable and respectable airline - stay away. At present we clearly are not their priority.\n\nThere really should be a Royal Commission into this. Australian taxpayers did NOT invest money into this airline to be treated this way.","813":"After canceling my flight, I was charged 4,000 Danish kroner instead of 3,000 Danish kroner as a cancellation fee, even though I took a screenshot of the fare rule during the booking process and sent it to Qantas - a loss of 135 Euros (AUD 200). Qantas is a disgrace: never again!!","814":"I went online to book business return flights to Melbourne. Gave my credit card, Frequent Flyer details etc. Got a booking reference. 4 days later no email, tax receipt, no $ taken from credit card. Went back on line cant re-order tax rec, booking confirmation. Have been on hold 1 hour 27 minutes and counting. Another Trip Advisor had similar issues 18 March. Their on line booking system has big problems. As does their call centre. Easier to drive to Melbourne than spend hours just trying to book flights, let alone travel on a covid ridden plane. If thinking about business travel - 100% better plan is to use Teams \/ Skype. Qantas used to be really good, i would hate to think what the others are like nowdays......","815":"Supper served in a small box, the lid had to be fully bent back so you could search for the chicken in some sort of pasta. I found just five pieces. Just awful. Plus a small wrapped chocolate that when I unwrapped had melted so I dumped it.\nNever bothered with the breakfast so cannot comment.","816":"Booked and paid 12 March 2022. No eticket received by 25 March. Spent 6 hours waiting on the phone. Finally got to speak to someone who said my eticket would be emailed in 24 hours. 5 days later still no eticket. Looks like another marathon phone call coming up for me. I am surprised that there are no staff available when QANTAS are spending big on getting people to travel.\nNot happy with the lack of service.","817":"Qantas clearly has no system to issue flight credit unlike Air New Zealand or Jetstar. I have sat on hold for 2-3 hours and emailed twice with no response.\n\nWith both Air NZ and Jetstar using my flight credits was immediate and straightforward .I booked the flight then at payment page entered the credit code into the booking. Both Air NZ and Jetstart booking systems immediately applied the credit. All sorted in a few minutes.\n\nAvoid Qantas if you can!","818":"Flying from Perth to Bogota alone with a toddler, to find out by text message when I arrived to Sydney that the entertainment system on my flight from Sydney to Los Angeles ( 13 Horus flight) was not working....... How do you survive a long trip with a toddler without entertainment, it was a nightmare, no other options provided at all, definetly not happy with the service of the airline at all.","819":"Their entire customer service system directs you to use the phone call centre but it is impossible to get through. I was so super-wary about using them and this is such an absolute disaster, car crash of an operation. AVOID AVOID AVOID","820":"I used to fly only Qantas ... now I will never never never try to fly Qantas again.

Been on hold over 4 hours now.....","822":"Booked on internet it sad confirmed but didn\u2019t take out cash and points after 3 hours waiting on the phone I gave up and booked with another airline within 5 minutes","823":"After having Sunshine Coast > Sydney, Sydney > Perth RTN, I have accumulated a fair amount of credits among other flights. Unlike Jetstar, they make it EXTREMELY hard to use your credits. To add insult to injury, half the credits were allocated to 'Reed flight' credits - which you have to call through to the call centre to use, and the other half - 'Qantas Pass Plus' - supposedly making it easier to redeem (only worse). Then, you'll be confronted with a 2.5hr (at least) wait on the phone, only for it to hang up when someone answers. An absolute shambles of an Airline! People moan about Jetstar - Jetstar P1SS3S on Qantas on every front. Qantas is like BA before they realised they had a BIG problem. This Airline is an embarrassment to Australia. Unfortunately, I am only booking due to the credits I have accumulated. Oh, and the old 717 they shoved me on - the interior came off during flight, exposing what looked like foil paper for your barbie. DISGUSTING!","824":"A frequent (lifetime gold) traveller. My wife due to return in only available flight (JQ725). Five hours waiting at the airport. No contact centre at all for Jetstar and 1.5 hours waiting on Qantas call centre.\n\nBack to the bad old days Qantas\/Jetstar? Infuriated by rubbish ads on the hold about how supportive Qantas are and then directives to be respectful when clearly there is none being reciprocated.\n\nAssure you Qantas. Every chance to reciprocate will be sought and executed.\n\nYour disrespect has been noted Qantas. And will be remembered for a very long time.","825":"On hold for 4hrs and 28mins.

They then have the gall to put me through to their feedback service.","826":"I think we have broken the guiness book of records for the longest wait on hold to Qantas.\nWe couldn't use the flight credit option online so we had no other option than to call.\nFirst call we waited 7 hours and no response.\nSecond call we waited 3 hours no response.\nThird call we waited 7 hours again and no response.\nFourth call and after another 6 hours wait we finally connected to be disconnected after we were put on hold and no call back.\nFinally we got resolved after another 7 hours on hold and flight changed.\nWouldn't you think that after the terrible time that airlines went through during covid that they would put extra effort into getting themselves back into business through A+ service.\nThey are absolutely the worst company to deal with at the moment.\nUse another airline if you can.","827":"ohh where do i start. So i book a one way ticket from Brisbane to Kuala lumpur, it was very late at night when i booked and i made a mistake, on one of the passanger name i missed one letter...one single letter. How hard can this be to fix?\n\nThe flight was a mix of 2 flights Qantas + Malaysia Airline\n\nI call qantas with a call back service, after 4 hours i get a call back from their support, i explain the situation but nothing can be done because allegedly the other airline was preventing them from updating the details.\n\nSo a good customer service would have told me not to worry, they'll fix it, maybe it might take a few days and that's it.\n\nNOT Qantas, the advice was I call directly Malaysian airline and get them to change. The second advice was to send them an email expalining the situation using the email on the website.\n\nNow what do you think another airline would tell you if you aske them to change a flight booked on the Qantas website and paid on the Qantas website?\n\nYou guess right, the simply won't do it and ask for Qantas to contact them.\nWhat abot the email on the website...ohh ther is NO EMAIL on the website to contact customer service.\n\nSo i call again, this time don't even get the recall option so i wait 4 hours on the line.\nSame advice again, i have to contact the other airline and fix it.\n\nAt this point i was a bit frustrated so i decide to cancel the flight, easy process except to get the money back...8 weeks! Now my flight was a sub 1000$ dollar, what if it was 10.000$? And still in 2022 with this BS when it comes to refund, it took half a second for my money to leave my account why 8 weeks? in 2022?\n\nOk you might think i'm done, i go and check my account only to find they charged me twice and i mena not a pre authorization and an actual charge, I mean 2 SEPARATE CHARGES. Again immagine if it ws a 10.000$ flight?\n\nYou are a joke as compnay, your customer service is sub-zero, the IT infrastructre\nis from 2005 and your return policies are like a company operating in the 90's.","828":"Qantas surely must have the worst helpline service. Website wont accept a payment and have been on hold for almost an hour to try and get someone to help. Still waiting","829":"It has been an harrowing experience dealing with Qantas Airways right from booking using a flight credit ( which doesn't happen online), calling them is another nightmare, 4 hours on Hold, no callbacks and then they don't resolve the issue. We had to cancel the flights since the Syd-Delhi service sounded iffy and after 9 weeks, I am still chasing my refund. I was told to write an email to update the payment method. Now after spending another week on calls, they are asking for JP signed stat-dec for new payment details. Absolute joke !!","830":"If you're travelling business class, you expect a decent experience. This wasn't it.\n\nto be fair, the inflight staff were friendly and, for the most part, attentive. However, if they have taken things away to hang them up, you really shouldn't have to chase them to go find your things when you arrive at the destination. The woman across the aisle from me was disabled and needed staff assistance with her crutches. At the end, they forgot about her and only came running when she started calling for her crutches so she could disembark.\n\nAs for the food. Well, a letdown.\n\nI had Caribbean Pork with a pineapple salsa and rice. Stone cold. Rice cold and stuck together in congealed lumps. The pineapple salsa was a third of a slice of pineapple cut into little bits. Sorry, you need a little more by way of ingredients to convert a chopped fruit into a salsa. The pork was substantial in size but was flavourless. There were no discernible spices and couldn't by any stretch be called Caribbean. I know - I lived in the Caribbean for several years.\n\nLater I had bacon and eggs with mushrooms and tomatoes for breakfast, with toast and marmalade. All stone cold.\n\nThe red wine: they has shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. There's nothing like a good red wine and this certainly was nothing like a good red wine. Acidic and one of them was distinctly fizzy - it would make a damn good paint stripper.","831":"I booked a business class ticket to Adelaide from Brisbane 2 weeks before departure.\n\nAfter booking I've never received an e-ticket or confirmation per email. I was only able to see my booking online and on the Qantas app.\nI didn't change any of my existing details with Qantas and on the same email address I've received tickets and confirmations before.\nAfter that I've tried to request an invoice online multiple times which ended in receiving an error message. I also tried to call customer service, which I gave up after waiting 1 hour in the queue and the offered call back never came.\n\nBefore the flight I checked in online which worked fine and received my confirmation of check-in and my boarding pass.\n\nThen, 2 hours before departure I received a call from Qantas and they told me the flight is oversold and I have to take the next one, which is 10 hours later or downgrade to economy class.\nDue to I had to be in Adelaide at a certain time I didn't have a choice and agreed to take the economy ticket, mostly I fly economy anyway.\n\nWhen I asked what the price and the refund is going to be it turned out Qantas charges me $800 for a eco-flex ticket which usually only cost $600, and I know because I have booked that ticket multiple times before and even my return flight is eco-flex for $600.\nThe lady on the phone told me she can only give me the currently available price which of course is much higher 2 hours before departure.\n\nSo, not only am I downgraded shortly before the flight, on top of that I am punished for Qantas mistake of overselling and have to overpay for a ticket just to get to my desired destination in time without being offered a better deal or any kind of compensation.\n\nIt's really not nice to feel being taken advantage of because I have a schedule.\n\nUnfortunately Australia doesn't have many airlines to choose from and they get away with bad customer service. I guess they need more competition to be forced to improve their services.\n\nI never experienced such a bad customer service in over 10 years of frequent flying. 90% of my over 200 flights were done with Star Alliance and they offer great service.\nThat really makes me miss the times back in Europe where airlines can't afford bad service and still value their customer especially when flying business class.","832":"They are double charging flights and then telling customers they will have to wait 4 to 5 weeks for a refund. The call queus are hours and repeated hang ups. Sounds like they are trying to avoid customers over some software issue that went terribly wrong but they won't own up and fix it. Here's some Facebook postings from family there in Brisbane.\nSHOCKING!!\nQantas - I woke up to a duplicate charge of $5,114.16 on my Westpac statement. I was told it would be 7 business day before the money would be returned. Unacceptable. I waited on hold for 47 minutes for a supervisor before the call was terminated without notice.","833":"I booked three tickets to NZ on Wednesday and the full fee was charged to my credit card on The same day. On Thursday the same credit card had three individual charges for each ticket. I have been on hold now for 4 hours (no other way to contact them known). Absolutely despicable!!! I agree with a previous post, it really is a \u201csick joke\u201d. I have avoided flying with Qantas generally because I hate their inflight service (surly generally) but this is literally unbelievable. I\u2019m just going to call my bank to dispute the charges!","834":"Somewhat delayed due to a technical fault but the pilot made up time landing in Sydney as scheduled. Service was efficient and the meal was quite OK. The entertainment system is quite rudimentary and they could easily improve with a better quality screen. A Boeing 737-800 with quite compressed seating makes for close contact with neighbors.","835":"This flight was the first sector on an international award to London using points. The regular price of this sector can be over $1400 but please don\u2019t ever pay that!\n\nThe check in was amazing - so nice to have a knowledge and friendly agent.\n\nThe qantas club in Hobart is adequate but they need more proactive service. Pleas replenish foods and clear plates.\n\nThe food on board was tasty enough but the dessert consisted of one Lindt Lindor chocolate. Really? For a $1400 flight?\n\nService was efficient but no warmth.\n\nThe flight arrived on time but we had to wait ages for our business tagged bags. Qantas never do the priority tags properly.","836":"Great service by wonderful cabin crew. Rachael looked after us from step on to step off. The food and wine was delicious as always.","837":"I bought tickets NZ-BR early 2020 and due to Covid flights were cancelled. A voucher was given and now that I am able to use it, after the route that I need is active again, I am forced to wait on the phone since they don't give me the option to use the voucher online. I waited for more than 3 hours each of the last 3 days and am waiting for 1 hour now while typing this...\nAt the time a refund was offered but due to airline cashflow issues we decided to opt for a voucher, which turned to be a terrible decision. There are only disadvantages in asking for a voucher since they say you need to pay the +50% price increased fee and you can't book online so Qantas makes us waste our time waiting for absolutely nothing.\nThe time I spent on the phone waiting is longer than what I will spend on the flight (if I ever have the chance to book it).\nThis has been the worst experience I have ever had with an airline and would rather fly 50hours without Qantas then being in this situation again.","838":"I purchased a ticket directly from Qantas in late 2019 and because of COVID, needed to cancel my return flight to Australia in 2020. I was given a credit voucher - worth a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne (that\u2019s what I was told on the phone and later confirmed via email).\nSomehow already then - someone accidentally messed my ticket (first they gave me a credit voucher worth of 0$ by accident, then they corrected that to a credit worth around $430, and finally they corrected it to the original promise when I canceled the ticket - to another credit worth a flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne) and my credit and that\u2019s why nobody cannot find the reference number in your system. I have however probably tens of phone calls and emails proving that this is accurate.\n\nThen the voucher was extended first with one year and later on until Feb 2023 to be used, and I\u2019m now trying to use it for flight from Los Angeles to Melbourne.\n\nI\u2019m trying to fly back to start my PhD, which I was suppose to do in March 2020 originally.\n\nI have been trying tens and tens of times to reach out a customer representative at Qantas over the phone and with numerous emails. Only in the past week, I have been on the line on the phone waiting for approximately for 2,5 hours per day and when I finally get through and explain my case, the phone call always somehow (magically) cuts off. I have started to ask for the staff to send me an email in case this will happen again but I have never received a single email nor have I been able to book my ticket with the credit voucher that I currently have.\n\nI have called to several different numbers (in Scandinavia, US and Australia) and during some of the phone calls - the customer representatives have only told me that they cannot help me and that I should fly from my current location (Mexico) to either Dallas or to Los Angeles to physically go to the office desk to be able to book my flight with my credit. I really don\u2019t find that fair and have no guarantees that I will be able to book the flight.\n\nVery disappointing customer service.","839":"With the Covid issues over the last couple of years, when we needed to book a flight PQQ-SYD-LHR return we paid a lot of money (>18K) for expensive cancellable fares. BIG MISTAKE! PQQ to SYD is cattle class only and the small print looks at the cheapest leg. Been fighting for over 12 months and now they SAY they've put a credit into the origonal credit card which we no longer have! IFF you MUST fly with these clowns, book each leg seperately and just allow a few extra days to retreive luggage.Someone told me the acronym now stands for [ Quite A Nasty Trip, then a rude word that bebins with A *****, and as a plural, ends iwith S}","840":"Terrible customer service, if you can actually get on to someone to help you, odds are they won't be able to get what you need to do finished and will put you on hold and hang up.\n\nCurrently still waiting at 1 hour and 50 minutes trying to call again.","841":"Great flight we had no issues. Flight left on time. Staff were friendly and helpful. Quick easy flight. luggage all arrived safely. We were pleased with the service and had nothing to complain about.","842":"NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Can't be the worst if your company doesn't even offer it. Even though the website boasts 24\/7 customer support it's a total scam. Best airline in Australia??? They spend all their customer service department funding on paying for the votes. Ashamed to call this Australia's airline. They care so little they won't even respond to this. I'd love for them to prove me wrong.","843":"Travelled from Pert to Hobart. Checked golf clubs with high quality Ogio travel bag. In Hobart the clubs were delivered with the frame crushed. No one from Qantas at airport to assist so I called their customer care number. 1 hour on hold to be told nothing the agent could do but would contact baggage services and return a call. No return call so I tried Qantas customer care form. Provide all necessary details with photos. Ten days later no response. On the return trip went to baggage services at Hobart and Melbourne. Both agents said nothing they could do to help. Qantas, no response, no help and no customer care. If you\u2019re traveling and need your sporting equipment cared for choose someone other than Qantas.","844":"Qantas is now using an A333 on this route, no Dreamliner or A380.\n\nThe flight left on time (you would hope so given it was the only flight leaving in that whole hour)\n\nCheck-in was smooth as it can be given you had some people who didn't do their VTL correctly so caused some line hold up.\n\nFood was ok but was in good quanitity and offered regulauriy.\nI found service was good, place was only 1\/3 full so staff probably had more time.\n\nThe pilot was also nice enough to tilt the plane so we could have a look at Uluru and The Olgas which was a nice gesture.\n\nWe were bumped onto Qantas from Jetstar, however, looking at prices and had i paid the regular Qantas price Probably 3\/5 rating. Singapore Air has better pricing for better in-cabin service and food.","845":"Where do I start?\n\nFirst I'll qualify that all my calls to Qantas customer service have been prompted by multiple changes and cancellations THEY'VE MADE to my original flights e.g. didn't update my connecting flight (so I'd be leaving on the connecting flight, before I'd actually taken the first flight), failed to issue me tickets for their changes, transformed a 21 hour journey into a 37 hour journey, with a 10 hour stop-over. Note that in most instances I didn't receive an email notification that there had been any change, I just happened to notice it on my Qantas app.\n\n- Twice I've been suddenly disconnected while explaining my situation to the operator, having been on hold >1 hour.\n- Twice I've been told they would issue me an e-ticket, and flights on my Qantas app would be updated within 24 hours (my app said one leg of my flight was cancelled. Apparently it wasn't, but I had no ticket and an app telling me otherwise). It took 3 calls to get an e-ticket and for the app to update.\n- They advertise a customer care phone line in Ireland on their website. When you call you'll be put on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes, and then cut off. I know this because when it first happened I was confused why I'd suddenly been disconnected and tried again. At exactly the same time interval the second time, I was again cut off.\n- Once when I got through to them, I was informed they couldn't resolve my query at that time, and committed to call me back. No call.\n\nI've spent probably 14 hours cumulatively on hold to Qantas. They are a DISASTER. Check out the comments on their Facebook page, and other recent reviews here. Save yourself the stress and fly with someone else.","846":"Tried to call Qantas the last week to pay and upgrade my flight to business class.\n4 times on 4 different day I was on hold for over 3 hours and was cut off!\nAbsolutely UNBELIEVABLE!\n\nA very disappointed customer","847":"Qantas was once a highly rated and respected airline. It is not anymore and given their customer service it is easy to see why. A simple request for a seat allocation has so far meant 3 calls and over 3 hours on hold. Even though my frequent flyer profile says that I prefer an aisle seat (for health reasons) I was given a window seat for a nearly 15 hour flight. When I rang to see if it could be changed I was told it was the only seat available. That didn't seem correct as there were still plenty of seats available on the flight so I rang back to be told there was an aisle seat and they would change it and confirm in about an hour. 5 hours later there is no confirmation and I have been on hold for 90 minutes.","848":"I had couple of domestic and international flights and having experienc d Virgin, Etihad and Emirates...I found the Qantas crew very rude , racist and not efficient at all. They made fun of me when I said \"Can I have a can of Coca Cola\"..said it's Coke not coca cola..they made faces when anyone calls them for service, specially an old lady who really need some help...and would frown if some one would ask for water...what the hell, you charge a bomb....we are paying for it.","849":"I have a flight credit for a cancelled (Covid) flight in 2020. 5 days ago I re-booked flights for mid-2022, to use the credit and paying the extra for the difference. (had to do this via their phone line (UK), as this was the only way to use the credit voucher.\nSystem kept dropping me out when connected to a Qantas operator and then I had to go back into their long on hold to wait for another, This happened three times. Once all completed, I expected the e-tickets within 24 hours, but no. So I rang again after 3 days; same long wait time to get through to anyone. I was told the e-tickets would be out within 24 hours, but no! I'm currently (day 5) trying to get through again to an operator to see again if I can get these e-tickets issued, or what the issue is. This is extremely frustrating and I cant get on sorting out other arrangements until I am sure these flights are confirmed and tickets issued. Poor process and support from Qantas. (Compared to previously being satisfied with Q; I am a gold card frequent flyer! If not for the credit voucher, I might be cancelling this and trying other airlines.","850":"So I flew qantas from Sydney-Lax return ticket.\nI understand we are still in the pandemic but this was a complete let down and is the last time I will fly this route with them or any route.\n\n1. service wasn't the best - Food was very disappointing\n\n2. Sydney to LA we flew on the new Dreamliner. How is is that in 2022 Qantas do not have WIFI as an inclusion on their flights as an option to anywhere yet?\nDreamliner being their newest aircraft one would think that this would now be part of the service. Seriously, if i flew Business OR 1st Class I would be be so annoyed that I paid thousands to not have this service, especially in business class of all options. WHY??? isn't WIFI a THING yet with Qantas. C'MON get with the program.\n\nUnited airlines have it\nVirgin Australia have it\nPhilippine airlines have it\nUnited Airlines have it\n?????? I'm sure there is many more airlines that have it too.\n\n3. Now that Australia is flying again, start getting competitive with your prices.\n\n4. CHECKED BAGGAGE - Qantas have reduced the number of checked bags we can take. you are only allowed 1 checked bag if you fly Economy & depending on your ticket you book at a max of 32kg. If you need to check any further bags its $150 PER ANY EXTRA BAG. Honestly this leaves me SPEACHLESS.\n\n5. On my flight back the variety on the tv entertainment system was absolute garbage. only a few movies, programs, comedy, Australian (movie&shows)\n\nI was always a Virgin Australia girl because they are or were good but haven't resumed flying to LA from Sydney yet, but for now i will only fly with an airline that has wifi as an option or at-least free IMESSAGE.\n\ni flew on a few domestic routes in the US while i was on vacation and every flight had either WIFI or iMessage as an option.\n\nThe only POSITIVE feedback that I can include in this review is that i was lucky enough to have a full row of 3 seats to myself so because the entertainment system being a letdown, I slept flat for 9 hours of the 14 hour flight and it was the most comfortable feeling and I was so happy and impressed that I was lucky enough to be able to do this for the 1st time ever on any-flight but thats only because the flight was only 60% capacity and it was the A380 that I flew back home on.\n\nI wont fly qantas again.","851":"I WOULD RATE QUANTAS AIRLINES ZERO IF I COULD. I flew into Melbourne 8am Feb. 25th and I was told by the baggage service that QUANTAS lost both of my bags. They told me that it was scheduled to be on the next flight into Melbourne and my bags would arrive at the airport by 9am the next day, be processed through customs, and delivered around 12 in the afternoon. 1pm the next day, STILL NO BAGS. No call, no email, no text from Quantas. So, I decided to check the \"Mishandled Baggage Report\" that the Quantas employee instructed me to use. The website did not work and kept saying to \"refresh the page and try again\". So, i decided to call the baggage service phone number and I was on hold for 2 hours before someone finally answered. He informed me that the website Quantas gave me did not work (which I already knew) and that i was needed to use \"worldTracer: to see updates about my bags. He also told me that my bags were not on the flight that I was told they would be on and that they were actually going to arrive much later than I was told and I should be receiving my bags around 5-6pm. At 6pm, STILL NO BAGS. Around 6:30pm I got a call from the front dest of my hotel asking if I was missing baggage because a Quantas employee was asking for my information. WHY WOULD THEY CALL THE HOTEL AND NOT ME?! THEY HAD MY PHONE NUMBER AND EMAIL AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE CONTACTING ME TO TELL ME IF THEY'RE WERE ANY CHANGES, WHEN MY BAGS ARRIVED, AND WHEN THEY WERE OUT FOR DELIVERY. The hotel receptionist told me that my bags would be delivered between 8-10pm. It is currently 10pm and STILL NO BAGS. So, I try to call the baggage services phone number again and they are closed of course. So who knows when\/if i will ever get my bags. Quantas has the absolute WORST customer service I have ever had to deal with and I will NEVER be flying with them again. I would advise others to AVOID FLYING WITH QUANTAS AT ALL COSTS. They do not take care of their customers and they do not care if they cause you any inconvenience.","852":"We need a reschedule our flight, We are trying to call them since afternoon sometimes line was drop and I'm still on hold its more than 2 hours wait.","853":"We had to cancel our holiday to Hamilton Island in September as went back into lockdown. Whilst we were able to get a full refund on the accommodation, Qantas would not provide a refund and we were offered credit fromThe Flight Centre on behalf of Qantas for the flights. We are unable to rebook the accommodation in Hamilton Island so decided to book flights to Perth instead. We have almost $3000 in credit and the flights are advertised at $2500. As our flight was booked before the changes that came into play in September 2021, we are able to use our credit on multiple flights so we expected to have approx $500 left. The Flight Centre who we booked though originally have to book these flights on our behalf and they want us to pay an additional $300 over and above the $3000 which we have in credit. When asking for an explanation, the Flight Centre have basically told us that Qantas will simply charge us the value of our credit for the flights - and then an additional $300 on fare and tax difference!!!\n\nSo all in Qantas are charging existing customers with credit vouchers nearly $800 more than a new booking.","854":"I had previously been grossly underwhelmed on my trips with QANTAS so this trip was a revelation for me.\nAlthough in my opinion QANTAS are using an undersized aircraft (passenger capacity wise) for the trip.\nCrew were absolutely great. Attentive without being overbearing, cheerful & courteous. I just wish all cabin & flight crew were this good. Made for a very enjoyable flight","855":"We booked a business class return from Hobart to London using our frequent flyer points a while ago. The itinerary was originally a mixed one with Qantas, Emirates and Japan Airlines flights. I am Gold frequent flyer and my partner is Sapphire with One World.\n\nNow we understand that there are schedule changes at the moment. We had several on this itinerary which were not Qantas' fault due to changes at Emirates and JAL. However, you cannot make any changes online and have to call Qantas. This is where the \"fun\" started\/\n\nWe have literally been on hold for hours over multiple calls just to get this resolved. The South African call centre is terrible. They are useless and have no idea what they are doing. We waited for our tickets to be reissued for days - each time we were promised a call back and that it would be done in 24 hours... never done. They have to liaise with a team in Auckland who also don't seem to know how to do their job. We had an idiot who moved us from one flight to an earlier one and somehow managed to remove all our seating, passport info and frequent flyer details from EVERY flight on the itinerary. Luckily I noticed and we got the seats we wanted back.\n\nWe begged to be put through to an Australian person or a supervisor but they would not.\n\nI no longer value my Qantas Frequent Flyer status (and I was recently made Lifetime silver which is a lot of flying over 20 years). We have wasted over 10 hours on hold - so much hold time that the phone handset we were using has a failing battery now (not joking).\n\nThis is a disgrace. Fix it Qantas.","856":"Taking into account of Pandemic, overall the service, food and infrastructure was extremely bad. Our food on the flight was no better than a TV dinner and bread roll. The dinner service and breakfast was terrible, I have had better food from a budget airline than this.\nThe airfares were double what we normally pay pre pandemic. The Sydney Qantas terminal and check ins were hopeless.\nI will be choosing another airline to return home.\nAs an Australian citizen I was ashamed of the standard of service.","857":"South african shared flight, and customer support is terrible. The call center number for south africa never got answered, and the email address on the website also gets returned and can't be delivered.\nBritish airways delayed one flight by 3 hours and then cancelled another flight only giving me less than an hour to get to international airport in Johannesburg. When trying to change this flight, I called the south african number numerous times, over 3 days and never got through even though waiting for over 3 hours at a time. Eventually got a friend in Australia to call on my behalf and move the flight to an earlier option.\n\nTerrible experience! I really hope qantas changes their flight share partner to an airline which is more reliable.","858":"I have spent over 10 hours on numerous calls - yes 10 hours on hold waiting to book a business class seat on the phone - NO ANSWER. Why am I not doing this online as they only sell the seats by the toilets and galleys online - the real business class seats are no bookable online!\nThis service is a total disgrace. Booked with Singapore Airlines who answered in 4 minutes.","859":"Recently flew the long long haul from London to Sydney via Darwin. Service was good, seat and bed very comfortable, great entertainment but pretty disappointed with the food, particularly compared to business class on other airlines. Meals were either bland or over-salted, and the choice was pretty uninspiring. Missed the great Asian food on Cathay or Singapore. One meal was very much what you would expect in economy and have had better in economy on other airlines. This despite all the fuss about Neil Perry doing the menu...Food service was also pretty slow.","860":"Second time I have flown with this airline and I pray that I will have more choice in the future as I can say nothing good about this airline.\n\nTried on Facebook messenger to find out what time check in started at Suvarnabhumi Airport ( and I stated airport not online) but they said online so asked again, and again they said about online check in so asked again and finally they said when it should open.... and then they block me on messenger!!!\n\nThe flight was uncomfortable compared to both Singapore and Malaysia who I normally travel with.. and food... well what a joke that was, and on both Singapore and Malaysia food way better and far bigger choice of entertainment.\n\nI had just signed up for frequent flyer before this and after flight I thought I don't want to have anything to do with a joke airline like this and requested that my frequent flyer account be deleted.\n\nI have sent at least four emails trying to leave and received about the same back and each one stuffing me around.. the last one said it had been closed, but the next day I got promotional email with my membership number and when I checked saw they just locked it.\n\nMost dishonest company I have ever dealt with ...and there have been a few dodgy ones recently...but Qantas...what a dishonest joke they are.","861":"I was unable to fly on 14\/11\/21 for Covid technicalities and flew on 16th instead . I tried twice waiting on line for more than 2 hours each time to change the booking but no response . There was no international customer help even at the airport in Perth and I was forced to buy another ticket by a totally belligerent member of staff .\n\nSince then I have been trying to get a refund on the first ticket, the SMS service is disabled, I have sent 3 emails to the frequent flyer customer service e mail , all ignored and tried to cll again today with more than 2 hours waiting tie to get an answer . AVOID QANTAS THEY ARE A JOKE","862":"This is a three hour trip without entertainment. No prior warning was given which meant I didn't bring a book, magazine or alternatives to pass three hours away. Very dissapointing","863":"Just arrived in Sydney after a very good trip with QANTAS.\nStaff were excellent & cabin crew went above & beyond with excellent service","864":"My advice to anyone thinking of flying internationally with Qantas at the moment, DON'T. Pre-flight services are pathetic. I have had flights cancelled with no alternatives offered. Getting in touch to talk to someone who can fix problems is impossible. At every turn one is asked to phone 131313 for assistance. This is a call centre, possibly offshore. I cannot get an updated e-ticket issued. I am frustrated to the point of exasperation. Qantas, if you are not ready to resume services to customers wishing to travel internationally, admit it and don't do it.","865":"Booked and paid for flights for 7 of us in April 2021, fully aware that the flights were refundable according to Qantas, if borders were shut due to Covid. Qantas cancelled the flight in October and after speaking with a helpful and informative call centre operator, he assured us we would get a refund. We provided bank details to Qantas in October as requested, no refund. We called in December, after a 3hr wait, Qantas sent an email assuring us the funds would be in our account in 10-14 days. Mid January no refund. Called again, another 'reassurance' by Qantas that we would be refunded within 10-14 days. It is now mid February and no refund. So poor. Qantas very happily takes our money with the click of a button, yet do not return the funds that are due to us. I won't ever book or fly with Qantas again. Be wary of false promises. It may be time for the ombudsman to intervene.","866":"We were greeted at the gate by smiling and helpful flight attendants and when we were seated we were served by a warm and friendly attendant who enquired on why we were travelling. When we advised we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary we received congratulations by the crew we were presented with a complementary bottle of wine and a hand written card signed by all the crew. They went out of their way to make this a very special trip. My wife and I will alway remember this trip. Thank you.","867":"Service was very average and my wife\u2019s tray had food stuck to the tray and rubbish in the seat pocket confirming that the hygiene\/cleaning standards between flights were not adopted which is bad enough in normal times let alone COVID times. There were 2 lunch options but had run out of the 2nd option by the time the flight attendant arrived at our seats and gave not apology about the situation. There was also no refreshment offered before take off which was a normal service offering.","868":"Want to waste your money? Travel with Qantas. Want to be talked to like a POS? Speak with their customer service. Fly another airline. Avoid this overpriced airline.","869":"Domestic flight from Brisbane to Darwin was just OK. Flight attendant was good.\nThe business lounge at Brisbane was good. Business lounge at Darwin was PATHETIC.\nThe enterance to the business lounge at Darwin was through the International Departure, and that was only opened at the last minute (airport was empty) and had no time to get a drink. The business calss flight to London Heathrow from Darwin was a NIGHTMARE. We had a 3 year old spoilt brat with parents in front of us, and for the first 15 hours of an almost 18 hour journey the brat was SCREAMING, and nothing was done by the flight attendant or the brats parents.\nThe flight service was mediocre, and removing of empty plates in front of us felt like a lifetime.\nThe business lounge at London Heathrow was very, very good with excellent service, drinks and food. The flight attendants on our journey back home carried on as if they were doing us a favour. They were only a couple of the attendants that were really caring.\nWould we travel with Qantas again ????? I don't think so !\nFor the money we paid for travelling in comfort, it was far from comfort with the experience we had. Qantas ought to take NOTICE of what travellers have to say and try bloody hard to improve their image. Right now their image needs a great deal of Photoshop work to get them looking good.\nThe toilets onboard was small, and felt very uncomfortable. I wonder how a fat or obese person would have coped. They would not be able to get past the door.","870":"Quantas getting worse and worse , they have Zero or should I say -0 customer skills.\nCancelled my flight yesterday and said I wasn\u2019t even to fly because I am missing my expired passport for my son.\nToday I came back to take next flight and gave expired passport to staff , she said I don\u2019t need to look at it.\nBoarding time the Much experienced aged lady was so rude they really need to educate their staff especially customer skills.\nFlying with Quantas after 6 years for the same reason but unfortunately it hasn\u2019t changed.\nI wish I can give them review in minus.\nLooks like they have close their reviews on google.","871":"Calling Qantas and its super service promises leaves you at first with an impression of superb service and customer friendliness.

I was told that the refund and credit of points would take some 5 to 7 days. Nothing happened by 31 January. Qantas Service as it is.\n\nI waited in the morning of 31 January at home for 1 hour 25 minutes on a call to Qantas, then I got Jeff on the line from Qantas Capetown RSA. Unfortunately, the call at the South Africa-end was so bad and crackly, that I could not hear most of the comments from Jeff. I managed to have him confirm his intention to call me back, I left my number. This never happened! Qantas service at it is!\n\nI had enough and thought when driving to the airport, that I could approach the service desk and perhaps I would get help with the booking change. What an erroneous assumption.\nI went to the airport, via the toll bridge and parked in the Airport-Parkhouse.\nIn the terminal the friendly Qantas airport staff informed me that there is:\n\n\u2022 No more booking service desk at the airport\n\u2022 No Qantas office in the city of Brisbane in fact likely nowhere else in the country\n\u2022 But there are two telephones at the former service desk at the BNE airport where I could call reservations. Qantas service at it is!\n\u2022 I received a short dial number from a lady at check-in next and was told that it might take some 10 minutes to get through to reservations, what an erroneous assumption.\n\u2022 The friendly airport staff told me -to my surprise- that they would also call this number, as the employment of reservation staff was terminated a few days ago (There was nothing I could do and they were also extremely frustrated)\n\u2022 and all reservation work was outsourced by Qantas Management to Capetown RSA\n\u2022 Qantas airport staff are only able to get into the check-in system but are unable to change bookings\/reservations for customers\n\u2022 and that the QF airport staff had to also use the number, there was no other way to contact reservation?! Qantas service at it is!\n\u2022 A gentleman with his autistic son had to also use the phone, next to me, in order to advise Qantas, that due to an accident on his way to the airport he would miss the flight and requested a re-arrangement of his travel itinerary!\n\u2022 hard to imagine calling Qantas and having to wait for hours to get a response\n\u2022 after 'my neighbour' was apparently lucky to get through to reservations - after some hour 15 minutes wait at the counter \"only\"\n\u2022 no convenience like a chair was considered to be provided\n\u2022 he got through and his itinerary from BNE to Alice via Darwin etc. was adjusted with some considerable effort, I was able to continue with the call and\n\u2022 I was then able to speak to the efficient reservation lady and got my flights confirmed and received afterwards a confirmation in the mail\n\u2022 I was able to hang up on my airport convenience call after one hour and 55 min (I made picture of the phone as evidence last after 1hour 38 minutes.\n\u2022 cost for me: $30 parking, petrol, toll, time and endless frustration\n\nWhen I had to change my flight from BNE to MEL return, on 21 October 2021, Qantas changed the flight without my knowledge and approval various times afterwards, even once where the originating flight came out of MEL rather than from BNE. I chose to ignore this at the time of these inexplicable adjustments.\n\nTo blame Covid for these actions and inefficiencies is not acceptable. To delete service desks at all airports, city centres and offices in the land by relying on phone services only (prior to assure effective functioning!) is inconsiderate, in particular to the elderly. Not to increase reservation capabilities but to seemingly and deliberately outsourcing services to another country shows no consideration for a once great service company and lack of Australian attitude. To explain these actions with monetary efficiencies and increases of revenues might be a driver but these actions and decisions by Qantas senior management show considerable lack of customer focus and empathy for a lot of customers.\nI am sure not to be the only frustrated customer.\nWhat a horrible customer-hostile environment it has become in Qantas.","872":"Quite simply the absolute WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN MY LIFE. Like most people we have had to change our flight itineraries when flying back to see family in the UK. I cannot count the number of times we have been simply cut off after waiting for approximately 2 hours to speak with someone. The process for getting back a credit is also completely absent. Do not travel with Qantas unless you have no other options.","873":"I have now waited over a month for a response to my email and waited many hours online. I am at 3.32 hours currently on line and can get absolutely no assistance. They have my $2,300 and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it! Extraordinary that they claim ease of change o flights etc... They genuinely do not care and there is nothing you can do about it. You just need to understand that you are completely at their mercy. Do they have a physical office you can attend to sort out the issue?","874":"Extremely disappointed in Qantas - VERY difficult to contact customer service and when you do get through the operators are mostly unhelpful. My flight on July 18th 2021 was cancelled due to covid and I have yet to be refunded despite:\n-20 phone calls, total of 556mins - most ended by being cut off with no call back despite requesting one\n-5 unanswered emails\n-1 unanswered official complaint in December LAST year.\n-refused repeatedly the request to speak with a manager\/supervisor to get it resolved\n\nI also had cancelled flights with AirNZ, Virgin Australia and Jetstar and was able to receive refunds from all three companies within 2-3 weeks . It is almost 7 months after my flight with Qantas and I am no closer to getting a refund. It is embarrassing for such a big, 'well developed' organisation.\n\nNext stop is Fair Trading. Your customer service has been despicable.\n\n#qantas #poorcustomerservice","875":"Poor service\nI flew from Sydney to Johannesburg (South Africa) on Friday 14 January and returned on Sunday 30 January 2022. The return trip was a pleasure from start to finish but the forward trip left a lot to be desired.\nAt Sydney airport on 14 Jan, I together with many other people waited in line for about an hour just to have our documents checked before proceeding to check-in. These document checks had to do with COVID vaccination, PCR tests etc. The Qantas staff at Sydney airport seemed to work very slowly and were in no rush while we waited to be served. While I accept that some passengers probably didn\u2019t have their documents in order, the service was simply unacceptable and is no pleasant way to start a long, overseas flight. No-one even offered water to all of us standing in line and there were some elderly people whom I think must have been struggling. By contrast, I should point out that check-in for the return flight from South Africa, which was handled by African staff working for Menzies Aviation, was quick, efficient and the staff were exceedingly polite.\nWhen booking my ticket to Johannesburg, I ordered gluten-free meals. When I checked in at Sydney airport, after the hour-long wait in line, the staff member even confirmed my choice of gluten-free meals. Onboard the flight to Johannesburg, I noticed that other people who had ordered special meals were served before everyone else but I was simply left out. I was in fact about the last passenger to be served onboard and the staff didn\u2019t even know that I\u2019d ordered gluten free meals or else they simply didn\u2019t care; I must say that their general service was subpar. On the return flight, the staff were well aware of my request for gluten free meals and their service was good and they were polite.\nI must say that the service provided by Qantas staff at Sydney airport and on the flight to Johannesburg was well beneath my expectations and quite unacceptable to me.\n\nTicket-price & changes\nWhen I initially booked the ticket to Johannesburg, I chose to buy a flexi ticket for both sectors ($3100) which related to my concern over possibly contracting COVID and that I might be forced to buy a whole new ticket if that happened. There were, in fact, only flexi fares available for the return sector.\nI wanted to extend my stay while in South Africa by changing my return flight from Sunday 30 January to Friday 4 February and despite having paid for a full flexi-fare, Qantas wanted to charge me an additional $450 to change my return flight (yes you read that correctly)! While return flights were initially available on 4 Feb and 6 Feb, after a while these dates were simply blocked out and the soonest return flight that was available was Wed 9 Feb. I checked this several times to ensure that this was in fact the case. Unless the scheduled flights on 4 and 6 Feb were completely full, which would be highly surprising as my flights were far from full, this sudden blocking out of flights is quite unprofessional, quite apart from the extortionate fees to change even a flexi ticket.\n\nMy advice is, be careful when considering flying to South Africa with Qantas, despite the direct flight.","876":"I spoke to Milly at Qantas today and gave her my email address, my QFF number and my mobile number and I asked her to help me and promise that she wouldn't put me on hold because for the third time over the last 2 days I was put on hold and disconnected - Milly put me on hold! Guess what? She promised to call me back - she hasn't. Yesterday I was promised, by someone called Shrin, an email in one hour - that was 25 hours ago!! Yesterday I was also promised help by someone who didn't give me their name - nothing!\n\nIf Alan Joyce or any Executives or Directors of Qantas actually read any of this can I just say that it appears pretty obvious that you have a problem!! Maybe you could redirect some of the taxpayer funds that have propped you up over the last couple of years and actually get something done about customer service? Qantas has had my $2,500 plus for nearly 2 years - all I want to do is make a booking with my money using credits that you gave me but then converted to something called QantasPass - which I can't use because you have not sent me the QantasPass number and expiry date so that I can use it.\n\nIf you can't honour your flight credits then give me my money back and I'll book with Virgin","877":"We have been loyal frequent flyer members with Qantas ever since we started flying. Nearly all of our flights interstate and overseas were with Qantas.\n\nHowever they have shown a severe lack of customer service and customer loyalty during the pandemic. I understand that as a business they had to cut costs but to have a customer service team that takes 4 - 5 hours to answer and still have no ability or skill to solve issues takes a very low level of care from a company towards their customer base.\n\nWe flew with Qantas to Honolulu from Sydney after nearly 2 years of lockdowns. On our second day in Hawaii I received a text from them stating they were cancelling all flights to and from Honolulu going forward until the end of March. They gave us a \u201cpriority\u201d number to call to rebook on other airlines that they had supposedly \u201csecured\u201d seats for us to go back home.\n\nAfter being on hold for 30 minutes we were connected to the usual Phillipines customer service team who had no idea what we were talking about. A couple tries later and we finally got a hold of someone that knew the situation only to be told that we had choice of either going back home the next day or waiting until March !!! To top of it all off when we said that was ludicrous and we want a refund for our second leg, the customer service rep told us that because we were choosing to not take up their offer to return we will loose most of our money and get a refund of $95 dollars for a $900 dollar flight.\n\nWe now have to fly to LA and fork out the extra cost for a one way ticket back home to Sydney.\n\nSafe to say I will be dumping all my Qantas points and never flying with them again.","878":"Just to be clear, I've nothing against the great staff who work with Qantas who go out of their way to make passenger life better. I appreciate them working through this pandemic. This is purely a reflection to management to not prioritise customer service.\n\nWe booked through Qantas for our first trip post the pandemic to see the family. We were under the impression that flying with Qantas with a semblance of being in control as I presumed Qantas would be there if we needed help.\n\nThey are practically non existent in terms of if you need need help via phone, email and chat. The three things you need response if you are flying in these times and things fast changing and we needed their help.\n\nI spent around 16 hours at this point on the phone only to get no reply from them. This is to change my flights as we contracted COVID.\n\nI spent few more of these hours before we flew to clarify some visa rules. Except Qantas every other entity we dealt with, even immigration had some reasonable waiting periods.\n\nQantas has been the worst in terms of reachability.\n\nYour contact numbers in India don't work. The office seems to be closed all the time.\n\nThe Singapore office seems to be the only one reachable from within India for 24\/7 and even their waiting times are horrendous. I was able to speak to them last week after waiting for over 2-3 hours. Today even that doesn't work as well.\n\nThey have no advertised internationally reachable Australian number on the site. That's un-acceptable for a national airline.\n\nTheir 131313 number is only reachable if you have a roaming Australian number, even that has waiting times over 2 hours and I've been online for almost 3 now. Got disconnected after 3 hours in a previous try.\n\nLack of a 24\/7 web chat or a contact us form within the `My Bookings` section in this day and age does not bode well.\n\nThis has shaken my confidence in ever trusting Qantas again. We hope to trust big brands when things are not going well. They have proven me wrong.","879":"We arrived at the airport 35 minutes before our plane was supposed to leave. Quantas proceeded to tell us we were too late and too bad. I understand that you need to arrive 30 minutes before, but in saying that the level of empathy from the staff was just poor. Telling us that the \"system\" locked them out and there was nothing they can do about it. I am sure this is not the first time this has happened and giving us the \"oh well\" approach with no attempt to rectify is just poor. We have now been left standard. CHEERS","880":"I just flew from Melbourne to Brisbane on QF 604 on a drizzly Melbourne day.\n\nFlight left and arrived on time.\n\nFlight was not full so I requested an exit row seat. Was allocated row 14 all to myself which felt very covid safe.\n\nSnack provided was one of the better and more appropriate I\u2019ve had in a domestic flight for some time. It was a delicious warm pumpkin and bacon frittata.\n\nUsed frequent flyer points to purchase this flight.","881":"Hello Qantas !\n\nI believe today I have got the world record for the longest time anyone has been on hold.7 hours! If I didnt Im sure you hold the record for the longest you have left a customer on hold with no resolution to their issues. I understand that your experincing higher than normal calls but heres an idea how about hiring more call centre staff or even having a call back system.\n\nIf you care at all the reason I stayed on hold for 7 hours is after deducting my points and money the flight I had booked has disappeared and I cant get any assistance. I had booked first class.\n\nDuring these times when the aviation and tourism sector are on its knees your going about poorly in mainting your customer base . Maybe a little less focus on how to get money off passengers and a bit more focus on how to treat your customers well might actualy make you compatiable with other international airlines such as ethiad,emirates and singapore rather than a glorified budget airlines which you have become. Total disgrace being the national airlines of Australia!","882":"My Partner had a death in the family and needed to delay his flight to attend the funeral. Emirates (operating the flight out of Italy) advised as the booking was with Qantas we should contact them and considering the circumstances Qantas should waive any cost to make the changes. My partner then called Qantas waited on hold for 45mins until his credit ran out without any resolution.\n\nAs it was difficult to reach Qantas and I was based in Australia I offered to make contact and arrange the flight changes; the initial call took 3hrs before speaking to a customer service Rep, who was helpful and provided some options which I needed to confirm with my partner once it was an appropriate time in Italy.\n\nI called back later waited 3.5hrs to speak to someone, he then advised that there was not flight matching the details I gave (same details I gave earlier which were confirmed) and then stated that there was no details found on my partner. After battling with him to locate the flight and my partners booking he wanted to charge an additional cost for the requested change, when raising Emirates feedback was to waive the cost in such circumstances he then put me on hold for 10mins and then hung up on me sending to complete a customer survey.... Are you kidding?? Although he could see my number he didn't call back and I waited a further 2.5hrs to attempt to sough this out, we ended up going on line and paying for flight changes.\n\nIf you need any assistance with your flights Qantas is not the Brand for you\n\nPremier Price, Budget Customer experience...\n\nI will also add, I formally submitted a complaint to Qantas about this requesting a response, 5 weeks later no a word......","883":"Brilliant airline which catered to my food request without any fuss. The flight attendants were very attentive and friendly. Very comfy seat with plenty of leg room. Easy check in with all necessary checks in place which made you feel super safe. Would definitely recommend.","884":"With the Covid restrictions it was great they way the checkin was so organized and professional with respect to all the paperwork now required to travel.\nQANTAS lounge was basically empty but the staff were as friendly and professional as every. Had a meal which was freshly cooked and presented very well.\nPlenty to drink and snacks available but all service was at your table.\nFlight crew were once again friendly and professional with Covid reminding people when required about masks.\nFood on plane was good. The entertainment available was very good with new movies and TV programs to help eat up the time.\nInformation from crew and flight deck let us know what was going on. great flight with a very small number of passengers many who were travelling onto other more distant destinations.\nNice to be back in the air even with all the test and paperwork and subsequent tests at the destination and pre arrival back home","885":"\"Was told would get 100% refund of the points and the $. Got the points and when the refund of the $ was calculated, it was short of what was actually paid. Also was going to take 8-12 weeks. Only a few dollars - but if they are doing that for every customer!!!\nQueried the difference as soon as notified of the amount - so 8-12 weeks before it was paid and was told \"\"difference is the credit card fee and this will be refunded when the rest is\"\". When it was not, I contacted Qantas, using the same customer service reference. 4 follow ups over 4 months plus Facebook message....no response, nothing. TERRIBLE service. Appreciate these can be difficult times, they are for everyone. We spent the extra to ensure the trip was FULLY refundable, yet Qantas still feel they have the right not only to not honour their commitment, but then not respond at all. Ghosted!!\n(Note: for the same trip, booked one of the legs with British Airways - they were able to refund the points and every $ and cent 48 hours after the request, and that was over the weekend. For another Emirates flight, another trip - they refunded all out money, every cent within 4 days - so really there is no excuse Qantas can use - other can do it.....)\"","886":"Wonderful to see Qantas adding vegan options to their flights.\n\nFor both flights, I got a special vegan meal that was off-menu before the food service began. Sometimes the in-flight menu was actually better and I asked to swap. The lasagne is INCREDIBLE!\n\nHowever, the lentil pasta definitely had DAIRY cheese on top. I have been vegan for 6 years and could taste it was dairy and my best friend confirmed it. QANTAS NEEDS TO BE MORE CAREFUL when labelling (vegetarian) items as (vegan) because it is confusing and can lead to harmful allergic reactions.","887":"We enjoyed our time in Melbourne as the Qantas Club was closed so we got to go to the nicer Business lounge. The airport was dead quiet due COVID. The plane was late boarding due to catering truck being late. We laughed as we know the terrible catering recently so thought we would rather go on time and leave the food behind. As predicted the food was cheese\/crackers and water. Where is the wine and juice? The flight was empty and we had an exit row so it went fast. Just the usual average Qantas service. Nothing bad, nothing great. But time to improve the catering. Jetstar catering is better...","888":"One would have thought that with Qantas' Fly Flexible hype, coupled with a first class ticket it would be straight forward to cancel the book flight and book another.\n\nDespite 5 tickets being available on the new flight for sale at the same price as the original cancelled ticket IF YOU PAY AGAIN FOR IT, but try to use the refund credit and the seats are no longer available. Try to book and pay for it again with a credit card - what a surprise 5 seats are still available.\n\nContrast that to Virgin where your credit is good against the advertised sale prices. Well done Qantas - fly deceitful is a better slogan than flexible.","889":"Qantas customer servce is absolutely aweful! I will never go with them again. I booked a flight from Auckland to Melbourne, they cancelled it which happens, so nothing crazy here.\nIt says that I had to call to get my money refund, well, after 2.5 hours listening to their unique waiting music, they answered. I was told that I had to wait 7 weeks to get my refund processed. I asked if it could be done faster as I needed the money to get a new ticket, the manager promised on the phone told me they would call me back within today. They never called back. It has now been 8 weeks, and not only I had no phone call back, and my money has still not be refunded... I am now on the wait again on the phone - 1.40 minutes so far...\n\nI tried to contact them from their customer care form... No answer after weeks.","890":"Booked a multi stop flight. Impossible to reach customer service, phone wait is endless and no response to Facebook messages. A few weeks after booking I got an email some of the legs on my trip got cancelled. Rather than them simply rebooking me on the closes available flights (or being able to do this myself online), I was advised to contact them. Ended up filing a complaint as I'm not going to wait on hold for hours. Got a call, got rebooked, but staff member couldn't answer a specific question and I was told to call back at a later date. When I challenged that because of the hold times, she hung up on me. Never heard back. Don't expect Qantas to solve any problems.","891":"Booked a flight from Darwin to Sydney clearly this is a domestic flight but find myself on an international flight. No big deal you would think. Surely a major airline Qantas would have a sold system in place for domestic travellers they place on their international flights. No they didn\u2019t even have a system for their own flight crew. We were expected to wait with every other passenger and present ourselves to Border control. So you can expect 1 and 1\/2 hour wait to re-enter Australia but hang on you never left the Country. Add to this the fact that it took 4 phone calls all over 2 hours long just to book and use my travel credit and I am left thinking why would anyone fly Qantas.","892":"Our original flight from Hobart to Melbourne was on Jetstar but cancelled with one day\u2019s notice.... so we booked qantas instead as the time was better than the alternative Jetstar offered. The check in at Hobart was fast and friendly but then we had to wait ages for the qantas club to open. They open one hour prior to departure. Why not one hour prior to boarding?\n\nThe plane was empty with about 20 people on board. We had selected exit seats which were great for legroom. The in flight catering is pathetic. A snack box with runny tomato salsa and some crackers plus a water. No wine or juice offered. You get more from Jetstar with their meal voucher.\n\nFlight left early and landed early.\n\nOk flight - we got there but qantas service is average for the price.","893":"A once proud and competent airline has slipped badly on the basics. I know times are tough but the baggage drop at Melbourne was a shambles and reflected pure bad sloppy management. One self-drop baggage machine had no paper and could not print. The second had bad feed out and was stuck inside. When the only Qantas agent was asked for help she could not add new cards to her printer and then it jammed. A second printer was not working and we were sent to a check in stand that does not print out baggage receipts and after much waiting and confusion it finally was printed..All of these issues could have been prevented by careful maintenance of the machines, more staff and competent staff. Makes you wonder about the planes. I hope management read these reviews but I doubt it.The flight was fine","894":"We made a booking with Qantas Frequent Flyer points for travel for two from Perth to Hobart and return. We were charged 222,600 Frequent Flyer points. At the time of the website booking we considered the points charged as excessive, but proceeded, raising written queries with Qantas prior to our departure. These queries were ignored until just before our return to Perth. Upon our return we continued to seek clarification on the points charged, with a number of letters and emails. Qantas responded stating as we had \u201caccepted and confirmed the booking....and travel has been completed...we are unable to refund the points.\u201d A case of \u201ctake it or leave it attitude\u201d.\nWhat Qantas conveniently ignored however, was that we raised our concerns with them 27 days prior to our departure and no response was received until we had departed and our travel had practically concluded. This email was completely pointless as the horse had bolted. Had they responded before our departure in a timely manner, we could have adjusted our travel dates or cancelled the booking and sought travel with an alternative airline. Our travel dates were completely flexible and the lack of a response from Qantas deprived us of any opportunity to change our travel arrangements and mitigate the points charged.","895":"A gold member for over 8 years attempting to change my flight from overseas and what a mess around with a 2 hour wait period to take my call. Excessive delays and poor communications has resulted in a decision not to ever fly with QANTAS again. Their customer service is considered as extremely poor, unlike their competitive Emirates who promptly answered their phone and resolved all queries for my spouse within a 5 minute time-period; Emirates will now be my primary carrier.","896":"Qantas have a reputation and they uphold that based on the crew and service. The hospitality towards all onboard was warm, the cabin was clean, and good food, alcohol and snacks were served onboard.","897":"1\/ Trying to change my flight. Wasn't able to do online (an error kept on coming up), so rang their customer service at 8am to be told there was a 1-2 hour wait. So I asked for a call back. FOUR AND A QUARTER HOURS LATER I got a call from them. HOPELESS AND PATHETIC - ALAN JOYCE TAKE NOTICE.\n\n2\/ The food offered for a 3.5 hour flight was a miserably small packet of tasteless biscuits and a small hot or cold drink. I chose Qantas as I thought they would be better than Jetstar, but there is now not much difference.\nThey will give the EXCUSE of Covid, but that's BS.","898":"It have just been kept on hold for FIVE hours trying to cancel a booking as we are no longer able to travel. This was after being kept on hold for a total of SIX hours yesterday and still not having been connected to a representative.\n\nThe booking could not be cancelled either on their website or the app which just instructed that I should call Qantas so there was no alternative but to phone.\n\nI understand that things are difficult at the moment but there is no excuse for such poor customer service.\n\nWith this in mind I suggest that you think very carefully before booking Qantas in case you like, like me, you have to contact them.","899":"Avoid Qantas long distance on international flights at all costs. Save youself the heartache. ItItssnot worth it","900":"I booked my flight online on weds, by Fri the $740 was charged to my credit card, but I had no confirmation of booking. I called qantas and was on hold for 2 hours before I gave up and booked the flights again. Now I've been charged twice for the same flight, AND they lost my luggage. Terrific trip, thanks for the stress and anxiety.","901":"Our cairns business trip was ruined when both my partner and I had our luggage lost by qantas with our medicine and belongings. We were told if it's returned to us in 24 hrs, there is no reimbursement. Now we are stuck in a new city with no belongings or our prescription medicine. We only booked qantas because the service with Jetstar was so terrible last month, I guess it's only virgin airlines left now for us regular travellers.","902":"Qantas cancelled the international flight my partner and I had booked for June 2022. We were not offered a refund. We applied for and were given a voucher on line. We tried to rebook on another flight however our voucher was not accepted as \u201cthe value of the voucher is more than the cost of the new flights\u201d!? We tried to upgrade to premium economy, but the voucher was still not accepted. We even tried business class, to no avail. We had also paid $280 US for seats with \u201cextra legroom\u201d but could not get a refund for these online either.\n\nI phoned a Qantas reservations, entered my Frequent Flyer number, and waited on hold for two an a half hours-no call back option was offered. I was then connected to a line with such poor reception that communication was almost impossible. Instead of attempting to sort the problem out from their end, I was given numerous almost indecipherable instructions on how to solve the problem online. After several attempts to recover our $280 US, I was disconnected. I didn\u2019t have a chance to ask how to use our vouchers to rebook our flights.\n\nThe following morning, my partner found another Qantas reservations number, one listed for Frequent Flyers. Again I was told that the wait time would be more than 2 hours but I this time I was offered a call back option. Two hours later, a Qantas agent rang me back. The line was clear, and the agent was courteous. It took almost an hour for her to rebook our flights, select our seats and organize a refund for our previous seat selections- we had to upgrade in order to get the extra legroom. The agent was patient and kept us informed at all times. At the end of the call I was asked to rate the call 1-5. I tried to enter 5 to acknowledge the help we\u2019d received, but the line went dead.\n\nQantas should offer all of its customers a call back option if Qantas has cancelled their flight. They alsi need to fix their online booking system so that customers have some chance of rebooking cancelled flights using Qantas vouchers and getting refunds for seat selections. To the agent who finally assisted us in successfully rebooking our flights, I say \u201cThank You! I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you a \u201c5\u201d rating\u201d - I was cut off by Qantas.\u201d","903":"Thie flight QF1748 MEL-MCY is operated by Qantaslink utilising a Boeing 717 aircraft with 12 business class seats in a 2 - 2 configuration.\n\nThe business class seat (1A) offers extra legroom with luggage having to be stored in the overhead compartment during take-off and landing.\n\nSmall tray table stored in arm of seat for use for meal service or to use for laptop or tablet.\n\nCharging points available for phone but this aircraft has no wi-fi or Qantas inflight entertainment system so you will need to bring your own reading material or electronic device and headphones to listen to music or watch movies.\n\nWarm greeting upon entering the aircraft.

Flew on a lunchtime flight where a light meal is provided. Got the most incredibly bland and skimpy beef sandwich finger. The beef was sliced so thin it was almost invisible to the naked eye sideways. It barely covered half the finger and some of that was fat. See picture. Flavor was dry bread. They just dont get it. Its an insult. And theres nothing you can buy to replace it. They hand out free alcohol on many flights when many people dont drink alcohol or want it on a flight. But food is important to all people. It doesnt need to be gourmet but it does need to be time appropriate, journey length appropriate and of a reasonable standard. Perhaps they are struggling financially and cant afford the extra dollar or two. Yet they keep catering to their alcohol drinkers free. Sorry to all our citizens that cant drink alcohol for religious reasons. This airline is not for you. And what happened to those delicious hot\/salad boxed meals from a few years back. Most my friends agreed they were often better than their business class meals. Not surprising since my only 4.5 hour business class flight was offered the choice of fish pie or caesar salad. Down, down. Its all going down.","905":"Been trying to get Qantas to find my daughters suitcase since Friday.

Have rung at least 8 times, been on hold for at least 10 hours (minimum 1 and 1\/2 hour wait time every time I\u2019ve called), been hung up on by pathetic Qantas staff three times. Been asked for booking numbers, baggage numbers, file reference numbers, been given an expedite tag number, blah, blah, blah. Four days later, still no luggage. This is infuriating and a f...n disgrace","906":"Pathetic customer service , rang their contact centre on hold more than 3 hours not able to reach to customer service. Just 1 word pathetic","907":"Waiting time for call is long (can be 4-6 hours). When you get through they put you on hold again and hang up on you after 20 minutes. You call again, wait 4-6 hours and it is repeated.\nYou tell them to not put you on hold and they finally help you change your flight. They promise that the changes will show up soon and you can download the new itinerary.\nBut the changes do not show up on the itinerary and they cannot give you a tax invoice for the paid changes you made.\nYou call again and they say they cant fix anything. I've given up and hope that my flight has been changed and I give up on getting a tax invoice for my payment.","908":"Made a booking with Qantas Frequent Flyer points on 27 February 2021 for a domestic flight departing 9 April 2021. At the time, the website stated that I had enough points and accepted the booking. The following day I receive an a \"no reply\" email from Qantas asking to call them about the booking. It was impossible to get through on the phone. The Qantas website continues to show that my booking is confirmed.\n\nOn the day of the flight, I receive a voicemail asking me to call Qantas. I tried to call back and was still on hold hours later when I arrived at the airport. The customer service rep at the airport advises that I do not have a reservation because I did not have enough Qantas points at the time of booking 2 months ago. I was required to pay over $700 to make an on-the-spot reservation.\n\nI've been through the complaints process with Qantas and they have refused any compensation or refund.\n\nAbysmal customer service. They need to update their website interface so it can process bookings and reflect their status accurately.","909":"We flew Mildura to Brisbane via Melbourne on Quantas, our first flight was delayed landing by 14minutes due to runway issues at Melbourne, they kept us up to date on the plane, they also approached us personally on the plane about the status of our connecting flight to Brisbane which was due to depart 30 minutes after landing, when we landed there was only 20 minutes till departure of our next flight, they allowed us off the plane first to give us the best chance of making it. We did get there but unfortunately our luggage didn\u2019t. On arrival to Brisbane we went to the baggage services to enquire about our luggage and the woman at the desk was already aware of our situation and took our phone number and address to deliver our luggage the next day when it arrived. The morning after we received a call that our luggage had arrived in Brisbane and confirmed our address and then a courier delivered our suitcases. Very happy with their customer services and the effort they put in to rectify something that wasn\u2019t their fault in the first place.","910":"My flight got cancelled. For refund I had to wait for hours on the phone with no luck as the line drops off every 3-4 hours. This issue is still not resolved. Poor service and extremely bad experience.","911":"I used to fly with other flights as I didnt see why the prices are so high. To summarize, the difference was a small meal which they give u! Is it worth? Not at all.\n\nThe staffs were not friendly and I didnt see the respectful behaviour which I use to see in my other flights.\nNever ever waste my money again on the Qantas flights.","912":"Hideously bad customer service with poor guidance for those recovered from covid. No help from staff in airport, emails unreturned and waited on hold for 3 hours with no answer!!!! No indication of wait times, no indication of queue length, no confirmation of emails received. I'm looking at a 3rd rebooked ticked in 2 weeks with more money shelled out for pcr tests every single time. I'm trying to get home for my sisters wedding and at this stage it is not looking good. I've flown with Qatar, Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, China and United and never had such appalling service. I am so disappointed and heartbroken at the situation I am facing with qantas making life more difficult every step of the way. I will never book with qantas ever again.","913":"I appreciate the challenges that airlines are facing during a very difficult, unprecedented time, but a little customer service would go a long way. Any response to a complaint is better than none, don't expect one from these guys. Firstly, the little bit of food that we were served on this 14 hour flight was an embarrassment to the airline. All that we were given for breakfast was a small bowl of cornflakes. Our flight attendants were friendly but were hardly seen during the entire flight. Our flight was delayed because of catering difficulties. We landed in Vancouver 34 minutes behind schedule. Because of this delay, we missed our connecting flight and had to take a hotel for the night. I've submitted a request for reimbursement of the hotel but after 9 weeks have not received any response. I would not recommend travelling with Qantas if you have a choice.","914":"I cannot believe this company is still in business if this is what they serve up to customers.\nlong story short booked a flight redemtion 1st class LHR to PER via HongKong (Cathay as the carrier) Plane changed by Cathay no more first class, these things happen. All you get from QF is an email saying accept changes or cancel. the revised flights are a pain and don't suit me but there are no options. early departure LHR and now 8.5 hours layover in HK...no thanks. For weeks I have been trying to call 'sorry we are very busy right now try later' Tried twitter 3 weeks ago...still no reply. Managed a callback request today (3 hours) but better than nothing...so I thought. Barely comprehensable consultant who informs me I can longer change my booking for free as I reluctantly accepted the change (through fear of not getting any flight home) Now a 'customer generated request'...guess what no availability, no points difference refund and no explanation or apology. I'm told there is no difference between a first and business class fare! QF website today shows a 80k points difference...wow! Useless Useless Useless. After getting the initial QF email Cathay also emailed...what a difference ' Sorry for the dissappointment loss of experience for your journey' we will be in touch regarding refund of price difference' I even called Cathay and they answered their phone in 10 minutes! Sadly they have no control over this an said you need to contact QF.\nI know Covid has caused chaos but really, anyone would expect better. Qantas have been lobbying their mates in government to get us all back in the skies and this is what we get.......I know who's phone I'll be ringing next time I want to travel!","915":"Booked my flight. Received confirmation after booking. App says my flight is cancelled and eventually put me on the next flight. Its cancelled. No email no sms. We wait for any update because according to the website, your told to do nothing and Qantas will update you. I called customer service to follow up because its less than 2 weeks before I fly. I waited 2 hours waiting and customer service told me the flight veen cancel because they didnt receive payment. My bank account shows its pending. She said the original flight is cancelled completely but checking westjet it's still flying and there are available seats. She cant confirm the later flight on her end. She can only process tickets for credit card payments. Told me she will cancel my booking and I can rebook. Ok. So when will my points be refunded? When will my credit card be credited? All I got was an apology that I should have received an email and sms. She confirmed my details. No explanation and no help . We will be stuck at Vancouver airport thanks to qantss.","916":"Just flew the new non-stop flight to London. The crew was a UK based crew who were outstanding. The only suggestion is to improve the snack offering as only 2 meals are served in the 17 plus hour flight. Would suggest some salads and sandwiches vs packed snacks eg potato crisps. Otherwise a great experience.","917":"Qantas has charged me for two business class return flights to Singapore, then cancelled it and gave only a email notification. Instead of crediting my credit card account, Qantas has given me flight credit voucher, explaining that I may choose to change it to a full refund instead if I call them on 131313. However, this line is either not answered or has waiting time beyond the battery duration of my mobile phone making it impossible for me to get a refund from them. In the mean time, they have increased the fare of any available flights by 100% to make it impossible for me to use the flight credit to book any similar flight during the period I can travel. As a scam, they have done it most professionally.","918":"This was the last sector into Sydney after flying in to Darwin from Heathrow. Unfortunately this is crewed by Australian crew (the longer sector is covered by London crew) and the difference was huge. Now we had the usual, \"I am too good for you\" type attitude. The crew were more interested in chatting themselves and organising their own lunches to be bothered by passengers. It was really hard to get even a glass of water - I felt like I was just getting in the way of their chats and time in the galley eating.\n\nA disappointing end to the trip. Time for some of these people to change careers........","919":"This was the first sector of my flight back to Australia after a trip to the UK. My plans did change due to Omicron issues so I was grateful for the flexible ticket and easy ability to change to an earlier date online. The check in at Heathrow was fast and efficient, if a little cramped. I got to use the fast track lane at security which was as fast as the name states and then had breakfast in the BA Galleries lounge as the Qantas lounge is closed.\n\nI was in 5K which is a great seat for solo travellers. Always go for the odd numbers as these are against the window and more comfortable.\n\nOne of the flights attendants was from my previous flight 2 weeks before. She provided excellent service as before but the overall crew were not as good. Some of the blokes were pretty casual and one guy just would not put his mask over his nose.\n\nI was also a bit disappointed that they ran out of sauvignon blanc wine and crisps after about 4 hours into a 16 hour flight. Come on this is business class - don't skimp!\n\nI was also disappointed to see that my tray table had clearly not been wiped down - covered in crumbs. So much for a COVID clean in between flights...... I don't believe any of what they say now about cleaning based on the mess I saw so I wiped everything down myself.\n\nThe seat was very comfortable and the movies were a good range. The food was tasty enough but not a very sophisticated presentation.\n\nI enjoyed the flight overall but not as happy as on the way to London.","920":"Horrible service. When flight from Syd-Auckland was cancelled, website did not allow refund, only a credit. After applying for a flight credit, no flight credit reference was given, and no confirmation email. No reply from Qantas via email. After waiting for 2 hours on the phone, the customer service representative could not resolve the issue, said they would call back, but never did. On a subsequent call, after explaining the situation extremely politely, Qantas hung up! Extremely unprofessional.","921":"Havent had a good Qantas experience for many years. Shareholders before customers. This time they cancelled my flight last minute and moved me to an inconvenient time. Options to change timings all involved connections and terminal waits. Who wants increased covid exposure risk these days. Same thing happened the last time I used them just before covid lockdown. Time before that I was offered Thai green vegetable curry at 10.30am on a 4.5hr flight. That or an apple. Or ghastly snacks on snack flights with sugar laden savory salsa dip and bird seed cracker. So thats full service. Do Thais eat green curry that early. Crews seem fake friendly and robotic. Its just not worth the extra money. More over, I could have booked with their arch rival, paid less, and travelled at the convenient time with a nice sandwich in my bag. Tension. Tension. Tensions.","922":"NEVER again will I book or fly with Qantas. Disregard the reviews of loyalist Aussies (I'm even an Aussie) who will blindly support anything OZ and declare it \"the best\" as this is their claimed \"national\" airline. This enables Qantas' extreme abuses and poor service rendering it the \"worst\" airline as other reviews attest. Forget phoning their call centre for multiple hours on hold, I've spent over 21 hours \"on hold\"!!!! Don't rely on your booking, as Qantas has unilaterally cancelled and changed my flights six times and then uses its time-expired future flight credit. If you get an answer, your requested refund is promised AFTER 2 MONTHS!!!!!, and then doesn't occur. Any flight points can rarely be used as very few seats are allocated for such and, if used, expect several transit stops and long layovers to your destination as I've twice experienced. My latest flight was cancelled and later made available AT TWICE THE RATE!!! The Oz \"convict culture\" continues as I will NEVER use Qantas again and glad to finally forever move from over-priced OZ.","923":"My son booked to fly to England with his wife Xmas day. Paid \u00a34,000 for 2 x return flights.\nQantas have changed flights by e mail 5 times, but joining flight from Darwin not changed. He has been on hold for 15 hours in 4 calls, with no answer whatsoever. Disgusting service. Stay away from this disgusting company.","924":"With 53 years old of age, I have travelled around the world for the past 35 years and i have never ever seen such a terrible customer support and un-organised Airline. This was the first time I used Qantas for my trip and i had a such a bad experience on a returned journey.\nthe Flight was Emirates operated by Qantas it means Qantas manages everything here.\n1- My original ticket was from Melbourne to Tehran with 2.5 hours lay-over in Dubai, my ticket got cancelled and instead another ticket issued with more than 18hours lay-over. for almost 1 week i have tried to contact Qantas to ask them to provide an accommodation to me an my daughter but i was not able to hold of any one and finally one day after 5 hours on-hold some one picked up and said this is not us and i have to contact Emirates. I called emirates and they picked up the phone very quickly and their answer was this is Qantas not us. No response from Qantas what so ever,\nafter 18 hours we tried to check-in for the next flight but Emirates couldn't find the ticket because Qantas didn't pass the new reference number to the emirates hence they couldn't find our tickets and we were close to miss our flight. Thanks to Emirate to help us to find the new reference for the ticket.\n2- On the returned Journey, from Dubai to Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne, we arrived Sydney on the 1st of December at 10:30pm and our flight from Sydney to Melbourne was scheduled at 7pm on the the 2nd of December. At 11:45pm airport security kicked us our of the airport with all the languages because of the Curfew and we had to spend hours on the street, No Qantas representative there to care bout their passengers. we had to stay outside for many hours, No communication, no access to toilets no water. this is what you expect to see in some third world countries not in Australia. We couldn't even get a hotel as we were international traveller. Qantas could email and notify us about curfew and provide us some guidance.\nI'm so disappointed of this service and never fly with this Airline.","925":"This was the second sector of the flight from Sydney to London. I was in the same seat 7A which was very comfortable. Due to a thunderstorm, we were delayed for about an hour before we could start off again.\n\nI was amazed to be served another hot meal after takeoff. I had barramundi which was delicious. I also pre-ordered breakfast which was to be served 2 hours before landing in LHR.\n\nThe seat converts to a lie flat bed with a duvet cover and a mattress. I am 6ft and was comfortable with room to spare.\n\nThe service was even better than the last flight - I think these are London based crew and they worked hard to make everyone comfortable (without the attitude sometimes displayed by Aussie crew - ie the I am really too good for this job and I am going to make you know it...).\n\nWe were about an hour late but the bags came off really fast - so I was out and away in my rental car about an hour after landing.","926":"This is the first leg of the new flights from Sydney to London that go via Darwin. The check in was fine but there is now a pre-check in counter where they check your COVID paperwork. All very polite but it moves slow so I am not sure how they will do this as things get busier. The security and passports took minutes as there was hardly anyone around...\n\nThe Business Lounge is closed so I got to go to the First Class lounge which is amazing. Love the squid main course and pavlova for dessert. Make sure you ask for Champagne as it is not on the menu.\n\nI had seat 7A which was very comfortable and I like all the areas for storage. It is worth being in the front business cabin if you can and if you are on your own, select odd numbered seats against the window.\n\nThe food was good overall - my main dish was a little dry but everything else was tasty. I watched a couple of movies and then we were already in Darwin. You get off here for 1.5 hours in a dedicated transfer area and there is the lounge for eligible passengers.\n\nService was good - I think these are Australian based crew.","927":"I rate Qantas as worst airlines for customer service, The average wait time to on phone is 2 hrs.\n\nI am trying to get a refund after their flight was cancelled but still no action.","928":"Moved to a later flight with no notification together with 30 other people as Qantas had overbooked for the aircraft being used.\nJust an email or text notification (like when you keep trying to sell me upgrades that I don\u2019t want) would have been appreciated so I could have made plans not to get stuck in the airport for 3 hours.\nVery poor service","929":"Returning to Adelaide after a few days in Brisbane was nice to see a staffed Business checkin Premium entry not open but so few people at airport this was not an issue Good lounge similar to Perth and showers open a must in tropical Brissy. Good flight to Adelaide and good crew Good vegetarian food choice available","930":"ADL to BNE in Business which was fully booked WiFi on board a little slow with everyone watching videos on their phones and tablets but still handy to have Reasonable food good service and good checkin in ADL ADL lounge, showing wear but spacious FLEW back in QANTAS Business as well","931":"Was refused boarding at the Qantas business checkin at 430 am on Saturday morning.\n\nI was told that I needed a special exemption to leave Australia (we have re-located to HK). We had all our documents organised re: cathay pacific and smart traveller website. I was accused of not having checked the websites and when I asked if there was someone who could help me was told, \"only the government can help you now\". We were basically told to go away and humiliated in front of other customers.\n\nI stood my ground and eventually after about 20 minutes the staff (Late 40's white woman name starts with D) came back and just continued checking us in with NO explanation or apology. Smug, arrogant , prejudiced, ignorant person with no respect and a terrible representative of Qantas, Cathay Pacific and Adelaide. Ruined our trip and could have cost us a lot of money.","932":"We booked return business class tickets from Auckland to Brisbane in June this year- departure 23 July. The standard of Qantas business class accommodation on this flight including cabin service was the worst that we have ever encountered in the hundreds of flights that we have made all over the world during the past 40 years. Other airlines offer economy seats which we would have preferred to what we got here. On 27th July, Qantas emailed and cancelled our return flights for 19th September when NZ closed its border. They said not to contact them but that they would email \"soon\" with details of either a credit or how to claim a refund. As nothing was heard by 19 November, we telephoned and waited 3 hours on the phone before being told that we could have a refund on our credit card for the cancelled return flight (approx $ 2500) but the credit would take a further 8 weeks to process. Even if we do receive the refund when they say, they will still have had our money for six months since they cancelled the flight. This is a completely unprofessional and unsatisfactory way for a large national company to operate.","933":"A colleague booked my flight twice accidentally due to a credit card transaction failing the 1st time, back in March. Its November now, still haven't received a refund after calling them twice so far and then waiting for the promised refund, \"up to 12 weeks\". Called them to cancel the flight before flying and at the service desk on the day. Still $1000 out of pocket! I've spend more than 8 hour on the phone to them, pathetic service. Flight was fine but the food was shocking. I'll fly with anything but Qantas from now on!","934":"Qantas was spot on with everything. The entertainment was great along with the service and food. Will definitely be flying with these guys again. !\n\nThank you!","935":"On hold for 3.5 hours. Same crappy hold music ( high pitched whine and 3 hours of Qantas actually thinking that I will ever fly with them again.\nThe hold music is correct, It is the \"Perfect time to \"Experience the Qantas Difference\" and see how bad and how far the have fallen.\nAfter 2 years of the pandemic there is not excuse for Qantas not to have the system back in place handle \"normal\" travel.\n\nAside from the non existent customer \"service\", the planes are dirty, and seats are horrible.\nQantas has always been bad, but in Nov 2021, they take this to a whole new level of rubbish. Thank God they saved Virgin so there are other choices (such as they are).","936":"Post-Covid Qantas has demonstrated one of the worst corporate behaviors that I have experienced.\nA simple act of redeeming vouchers (worth thousands of dollars) to make a booking has been made so complicated that - it cant be done online.\nWhich service-oriented company in 2021 relies on phone-based booking of the 1970s?\nI have literally spent more than 15 hours sorting out a simple process of booking domestic flights.\nI am not sure what kind of strategic planning was done during the quiet days of the COVID-19.\nCEO appearing on TV and saying book your holidays without actually ensuring that adequate IT system, processes, and staff are in place is laughable - seriously.\nThe post-covid debacle deserves a \"0\" rating!","937":"I purchased 3 plane tickets on the Qantas website 20 days ago, using BPay to avoid their shocking credit card payment fees. While the money was withdrawn from my account instantly, 3 weeks later + 6 hours on the phone later (being kept on hold for 2 hours every time and then disconnected) + 5 unanswered email later, I am left with no plane ticket. Yes, you have read this correctly: Qantas has not issued any of the plane tickets and has not refunded the money. It is impossible to get a hold of someone. This is absolutely traumatizing. I did not expect such a major airline to steal customers' money.","938":"Our return flight to Perth was very similar to the outward leg. Online check-in was again unavailable but again no problem at Brisbane airport thanks to the friendly and helpful Qantas staff. We were again seated in 17B & 17C, comfortable and with good legroom. Great cabin service, nice meal and an enjoyable cabernet sauvignon.\nNice to see large passenger numbers with the easing of WA border restrictions with QLD. Looking forward to our next flights with Qantas.","939":"After two previous cancellations due to snap lockdowns in WA & QLD we were very happy to be heading to Brisbane. Online check-in was unavailable, but no problem at the airport thanks to the friendly and helpful Qantas staff. We were seated in 17B & 17C, comfortable and with good legroom. Entertainment was so-so but still managed to enjoy a good movie for part of the trip. Free WIFI a bonus and worked excellent. Cabin staff friendly and helpful throughout, offered second helping at mealtime, appreciated as the meal was very tasty. Kudos.","940":"I had several Qantas flights cancelled due to West Aust entry restrictions. Trying to contact Qantas about redeeming credit was almost impossible. I waited 4 hours on the phone and gave up. They have made it as difficult as possible to redeem credit. I hate them with a passion and will use any other airline in future.","941":"On time, great crew on board. Perfect flight and in these challenging covid times couldn't fault anything.\nWould definitely fly with Qantas again over other r airlines.","942":"Cancelling a flight by text without any information regarding options is unprofessional. It appears this is Qantas standard practice to save money by removing uneconomic flights at short notice.\nBy calling 131013 I was able to find out that Qantas had fitted me into a later flight.\nWhy on earth don't Qantas just text you to say which flight they're putting you on.\nReminds me of the Qantas covid fiasco, waiting for a plane to London that never turned up. At least this time they let me know, and only wasted an hour rescheduling.","943":"TERRIBLE AIRLINE. Slow to update their customers, IMPOSSIBLE to get hold of on the phone, WORST SERVICE EVER. DO NOT BOOK with these your flight won't happen and you will tear your hair out trying to get hold of them to cancel them!!!","944":"This applies to all Qantas flights, this company is such a shame!\nI have been trying to contact Qantas since Jun when the flight ticket was canceled for the 2nd time. Total amount around 10K AUD. Phone call was never picked up (even waited for 2hours +), email never returned. A formal written complaint was returned once after 5 weeks but no further following up. BTW: I have been Qantas member for over 15 years.\nToday I called 131313 again and got a callback!\nFinally, the girl told me my tickets are in refound procedure and the money would hit the account after 8 weeks. No confirmation email, no reference number!","945":"A short trip to Perth Flew VA business from Adelaide which was pretty bad and Thk my stars I flew QF back Nice lounge at PER T 4 almost mirror image of BNE Domestic C lounge Good food and wine choices (vegan for me lots of salad and hummus) easy checkin with a hard to find Business counter. Easy to social distance as PER airport has extremely few interstate flights and consequently everything is closed In lounge its self service except for drinks I prefer Sydney's Domestic Business Lounge where wine is, self serviceNice flight back to Adelaide with WiFi and a great business flight attendant Many choices of good food and beverages so the almost 3 hours flew by Vegan meal for me on board with the classic QANTAS Grant Burge sparkling chardonnay Flight good value with American Airlines award only 20000 miles and taxes of $23","946":"Understaffed. If you arrive 30 minutes early you'll miss your flight. Don't use them. Use a different airline that will get you on the flight.","947":"Note this applies to any Qantas flight .\nI booked a flight in June to go to my Son's wedding, mid December.\nUnfortunately Covid came along and WA (sensibly) restricted entry.\nLast week (early October), Qantas emailed me advising that they had cancelled my flight. I understood the reason behind this, their business has been considerably affected by Covid and they are don't agree with the WA lock-down policy so rather than look to a further reduced operation they have cancelled all flights into WA.\n\nThat is their decision.\n\nSo my flight is cancelled with no option of other Qantas flights, but rather than refund my money, the money that they have had for 4 months, they give me a flight credit valid until 2023.\nIt has restrictions. I can not use it on a cheaper flight. If I use it on a more expensive flight I must pay the extra.\n\nThank you Qantas but really I want my money back.\nIf I had cancelled the flight I would have faced a penalty of $100 or so but Qantas cancelled the the flights and the get a reward of having my money for 4 months.\n\nThe only way to turn my flight credit into a refund is to call and speak to someone, despite being directed to their web site, there is no provision to even request a fefund for the flight.\n\nI call and the Qantas answering system advises me that there is a wait time of between one hour and two hours.\n\nI am 66 and I only have a limited of hours left in my life and I really had not planed listening to Qantas self commending themselves for 2 hours on the phone but I have no other choice if I want to get my money back from them.\n\nI think that since Joyce became CEO they have not travelled so well and they may not be in business long enough for me to use a flight credit. I have other things to do with my money.\n\nSo after 2 hours and about 14 minutes I get through to a Qantas Customer Service person who tells me that they can hold my money until December 2023.\n\nI tell him how they have cancelled the flight and I will now not get to my son's wedding, even if WA borders open up for double vaccinated people, and that I do not plan on travelling any where else.\n\nSo after another wait on the phone while the customer service person checks with his supervisor, I am told that my money will be credited back onto my Debit Card.\n\nBUT it will take 8 weeks!!\n\nSo I have lent Qantas operates by taking money up front for future flights but when they refund for services they don't provide they keep that money for an additional 2 months.\n\nI hope they stay in business long enough to process my refund.\n\nI spent 3 hours of my life to get my refund processed. I would much have preferred to spend those 3 hours on activities that I chose.","948":"I was unable to check in, your site kept saying that they could not find my flight! Luckily, I arrived at the airport early, so that I could just check in at the counter, to find that the ETD had been changed . I had no notification of that change of flight times. The flight left 20 minutes earlier than schedule.....","949":"Unfortunately on this fight my younger sister was air sick - and yes she liked on me. The crew was lovely, and a particular lady named Trudy Jones lent me her pants. Thankyou so much!!! Smooth flight as well, and awesome wifi!!!","950":"never got the flight as they kept moving the flight and then they said that oh well you have to cancel the flights. when we have booked and paid for accommodation and a theatre tickets. But they kept telling me how sorry they where...","951":"Qantas changed my flights four times in two days.\n\nEach change has moved the first leg of my return flight to a date and time after my return flight.\n\nI have spent hours on the phone changing these revised bookings, only for Qantas to change them, incorrectly, over and over.\n\nNot that this is really relevant as I booked dates to coincide with an event that does not just change to align with Qantas' requirements.\n\nThey must be annoying many customers, and to not have solved this system problem, that their customer complaints section confirms has existed for several months, is a disgrace.\n\nI have never witnessed such a disgraceful disregard for a business' customers, nor such pathetic response to an organisation's systems problems, which it has known for months.","952":"Very poor service, left mid way during shift and was waiting 30 minutes to check our bags in!!! Very upset.","953":"Rating is zero, customer service for a refund poor?\nI cancelled my creditcard, notified Qantas but they credited my credit to my canceled credit card. Now no bookingreference.....lost count numerous emails sent explaining this. No one seems to be reading these or my new account details. No PNR reference still no refund!","954":"Qantas cancelled my flight and still no refund weeks later. I've contacted them with complaints twice 3 weeks ago and 2 weeks ago and no response.\nQantas seems to have become a crooked service, use at your peril.\nNext stop fair trading, ombudsman and court. These crooks will refund me in the end.","955":"Fredelle was one of the most kind people I have found in my travels. I really appreciate her customer service and all the small details Qantas are giving to the customers! Thank you Fredelle and Qantas for the enjoyable and good customer service in my last trip.\n\nDetails: QF755 TSV -> BNE (7 Sept)","956":"Actually couldn't take this flight as it was cancelled due to Covid. 18\/6\/21 called Qantas, someone in Cape town answered and told me that flight is not cancelled, have to pay for refund to be processed so hung up.

No money refunded, called back on 20\/8\/21, wait 2 hours on phone, told I will be emailed, no email, called back wait 1 hour, told will check and call back...no call back, Called again, wait 1 hour on phone, told its processed, refund should be in by 24\/8\/21. Called 31\/8\/21. Wait 2 hours on phone...someone answered told will check and get back...been waiting for 2 hours on phone(total 4 hours today)....still waiting while writing this review. Bottom line; NO QANTAS in future!","957":"Up on boarding the plane it seemed ok but then we got to our seats and it was clear this was going to be horrible flight. Seats way too close to seats in front and to top it off person in front had a seat that came of the holding\/recline bracket on side so when he reclined basically his seat was in my lap. Staff however did come to have a look and did nothing at all to fix it. 10 hour flight was bloody disaster with no table either as seat in front being broken my table tray was not able to have any food or drinks placed on it as it would just slide off. The experience was bad to say the least.\nIt seemed like an old bus that had wings attached to it!","958":"Good flight from Brizzy to Msydney. The Cabin Crew were fantastic, real people not fake people'. The food was of a good quality and variety. The cheese & cracker pack with a small wine was excellent. The seating was comfortable, and the leg room good and the individual mini iPads provided good entertainment for the trip. The only downside was, I was given seat on one side of the isle and my husband on the other side. We did not realise this until we boarded the plane. We checked in as a couple at the same time but for some reason separated. I could understand this occurring had we checked in late but when there was a row of 3 empty seats in front of us, this seems appears to be an issue. Thanks to the passenger who was sitting next to my husband volunteered to swap seats after consultation with the Cabin Crew, but really, should this happen to begin with, imagine if this was a long haul international flight?!","959":"I was in the unfortunate position of being in Tasmania on 25 June and trying to get back to Qld on 26 June when there was a snap lockdown in Sydney. Flights were being cancelled and I received notification that my flight with another airline had been cancelled and I had been put on an alternate flight on another day.. I rushed to book a flight with Qantas and decided to book a full priced Business class fare at a cost of $1600 as I had to be back in Qld on the 26th and believed if there was a problem I would get priority. 15 minutes after booking this fare I received a text from the other airline saying they had rebooked me on a flight on the correct day. I therefore went online and cancelled the Qantas flight- to be advised that I would receive a credit voucher- are you kidding me. 15 mins after booking and a full fare that is supposed go be fully refundable? I couldn't get onto Qantas by phone as there were hundreds of people trying to sort out their travel so waited to the following week. When I phoned to say I wanted a refund not a credit voucher I was told I would have to apply and it would take up to 8 weeks to be processed. I advised that this seemed outrageous but was then told it probably wouldn't take that long bu they had to say that.\nWell, 7 weeks later I contacted Qantas again today- was on hold for 33 minutes to be told that they had just processed my application and I would receive my refund in 7-10 business days.\nThis is an abuse of the vendor\/customer relationship between Qantas and their customers. I was told it is taking this long as there is a back log of being wanting refunds- of course we want refunds why isn't this the default position for full fares rather than artificially creating an 8 week plus 'backlog'.\nI know the tourism industry is doing it though, but exploiting your customers is not the solution. That money means whether some of us can pay our mortgages or not- Qantas is just in it for themselves. Mr Joyce on your multi million dollar contract you should be ashamed.","960":"They kept hanging up every time I called and then I finally got through. When I did they hung up straight after fixing my flight details\u2026only to find out my flight was not changed and they have to s the situation. I am now waiting for them to change my flight and call me back about the situation. It is very tedious as I have to get back for work, but I can\u2019t keep calling qantas. This would be the sixth time calling in the past 3 weeks due to uncertain COVID situations.\nThere was in total 2 times out of the 5 where it was a pleasant experience.\nPlease make options to change flights available online! It would help a lot and make me more willing to fly with qantas again.\nTheir prices only match their on board service. I would recommend for flying, but NOT during COVID.","961":"My international flight was cancelled first time on Dec 2020.\nPaid more to rearranged it to April 2021, and got cancelled again three days before flying.\nCan\u2019t do anything online.\nCustomer service call center is just forever on hold.\n\nI had no faith with Qantas anymore and booked another ticket for the same flying date with Scoot. And I got on the plane. I thank Scoot for an excellent service and cost less comparing to Qantas.\n\nBiggest disappointment with Australia\u2019s biggest airline.\n\nI DO NOT recommend anyone to risk time and money with Qantas especially during this pandemic period of time. I am saving you from a lot of troubles mate.\n\nIt\u2019s July 27th 2021 today. And I am still in my refund process with Qantas. You tell me about it.","962":"\"Qantas, my 15 y.o daughter travelled from Canberra to Perth in April on QF857 and was served raw chicken for dinner. She sensibly didn't eat it, but was too shy to talk to the staff onboard about a replacement meal, so went without dinner. Want to bring to your attention this less than ideal meal, with its associated risk of salmonella.\"\n\nI contacted Qantas in April with this feedback - both through their website and their Facebook page - and I am still waiting on them to respond. Who knows how many other passengers since April has got food poisoning from their Qantas meal?\n\nNot very impressed at the non-existent customer service. Alan Joyce, hang your head in shame, because the buck stops with you!","963":"I purchased a flight ticket and accommodation, for two people, to Cairns in April 2021, when the government had the half price offer. Due Covid lockdown, we are unable to travel. I spoke to Qantas Hotels and they were able to change the dates for an additional $88 :-). However, Qantas being a large organisation, Qantas Hotels can't help with flights.\nI then rang Qantas and after 3 attempts, 2 hours on hold got through to be told I has to pay another $744 over an above $618 I had paid, and the government contributed $618, Thus total cost for return flight, for two, to Cairns $1,980!!!!\nIs this not price gouging?\nAnd I don't understand how a \"full service\" airline can provide such bad service:\n1. Non integrated offerings\n2. Inability to understand customer perspective\n3. Inflexible","964":"Our flight time was changed from evening departure to a 9am departure. No thanks and we don't want to go via MEL. As this trip is in August, we found better options and wanted to get a refund. Qantas tell you not to call them - you can do everything online. Well you con't! You can't ask for a cash refund. So we sat on hold for 2 hours. Once we got through the South African person helped us and we were told we would have to wait 8 weeks. In fact we just got the refund in 3 weeks. So that bit was good.\n\nQantas you are a full service carrier so staff your phone lines. And I am QC Silver...","965":"Long story short\u2026\u2026.do not fly if you are used to \u201cgetting anything that resembles the expense that you pay for\u201d & you must EXPECT to have ur flights cancelled or changed to an unreasonable schedule, that u then have to pay more to rectify the change they impose on you. Oh, also, don\u2019t think ull get even a cup of tea or coffee anymore either\u2026.I understand changes are necessary, but to make the changes unmanageable for people so as to incur a lot more cost to the customer is rude & obnoxious.\nI totally understand that we are living in a pandemic HOWEVER\u2026..Qantas was doing all this prior to Covid, now it just has an excuse to mess u all around\u2026.","966":"The flight departed on time and arrived on time and the Anzac cookie acceptable sort of, but the aircraft and older 717 was not as clean as one might expect in these times. The tray table had not been cleaned and was stained and sticky which does not indicate Covid cleaning awareness. The toilet was also messy with toilet paper on the floor. The plane was only a third full and had a tired unhappy look although the staff did a good job and were pleasant enough","967":"Qantas decide to cancel flight due to low number of passengers & offer either fly 2 days later ( expenses @ passengers cost), refund fare, by now too late to cancel all other paid tour, hotels & car hire or take flight via Syd. Airlines need to stop offering flights knowing very well that they can just cancel leaving passengers to endure stress and expenses because airlines do not have enough passengers and know they can make passengers divert through other ports with no though of impact to them.","968":"Diabolical customer service. I had my flights rescheduled because of COVID. Fine! I understand. Except that they rescheduled my first flight to land 9 hours after my connecting flight took off - so it was impossible to actually fly. How could a company with their level of computing, logistics and ticketing expertise not imagine and not prevent the problems that might arise if they only manage one leg of a rescheduled journey? Tried sorting it out on qantas.com and my booking just disappeared entirely. No voucher. No email to indicate that the booking had been cancelled. Nothing on qantas.com to tell me what to do next and nothing appeared after 5 days. Tried calling them but my phone battery ran out after waiting for 2 hours. Why isn't there a callback service so that they call you back when your name comes up in a queue? When I finally got through to customer service, they told me that when it gets too busy, they just switch the callback service off. This nonsense can't be blamed on the pandemic. They've had a year to sort that out and it's really not that difficult for an airline to manage two legs of a journey. There are fundamental problems with the basic competence of people who work in IT for qantas and those people need to be removed before anyone can confidently buy a ticket from them. The user interface on qantas.com simply does not deliver what its supposed to deliver. Let\u2019s just pray that the same problems don't eventually spill over into aircraft safety.","969":"ahem we are like you everyday Aussies. We just want to get what we pay for.\nSo we had 3 flight changes which stuffed up a flight.\nThis time the Adelaide Sydney flight changed so we get to Sydney AFTER the Sydney Hamilton island leaves. They changed it to ENSURE we can not relax in Q lounge ar even go straight to the next flight. Insanity rules at Qantas\nThey emailed saying they can SEE we have a connect to HI Wow they know and have ignored the obvious stupidity of their actions. 2nd time round. LAST time\nPHONE wait 2 hours. Ok Experiment one is this for ALL of us mates ok.\nWe phoned 2 Q numbers 13 11 31 and the 1300 . I am leaving the phone on a charger to see if there is ANYONE in the Qantas office at all. Is it staffed ?\n2 hours is crap as we had it on before 3 hours. So are they telling the truth. Q have lost the plot.\nYou CAN NOT manage booking online. When they say phone NO ONE answers\nThis drops Qantas from a top airline to a 3rd world status. Lower. TIME to change for good.... Will keep you posted if\/when we get a reply to phone call tomorrow","970":"Our last flight home on a smaller plane was pretty good. All the seats were not taken so we were able to spread out. I had a window seat over and engine and had great views. We were curiou what a \"Refreshment\" consisted of for the inflight food, and finally found out. A snack box with cheese biscuits, caramlised onion dip and 2 sweet finger line biscuits and a drink. Later on we received a packet of shortbreads. Friendly and chatty staff who were exceptionally doting on an elderly lady a few rows ahead travelling alone.","971":"QANTAS just left a message to call back because they have cancelled my flight. I called, and am told the wait time is between 1 hour and 44 minutes and 2 hours and 14 minutes. There is no chat option on their website. The fight is due to leave tomorrow morning. I wrote this review 2 months ago. I waited just short of 3 hours for someone to pick up the phone. Now it's happening again. Only they are now saying that unless I am flying within the next 24 hours, hang up and call again later.\nTime to lift your game QANTAS","972":"Contacting customer service takes 2 hours wait time compared to 30 minutes for other 2 major domestic airlines. Getting a refund takes 30 days(still haven't got it). Other 2 airlines took 2 days. Qantas...not flying again!","973":"If you have any reason to want to ring the Qantas helpline for clarification or help about your tickets, Be prepared to spend hours and hours on the phone with little or no chance they will answer. Dont bother writing an email complaint either because they wont acknowledge it. Avoid using it. I wish I had gone Air NZ.","974":"Excellent flight under difficult circumstances. Staff were professional and service was good. Seat comfortable and flight arrived on time","975":"Actually not a bad flight. Left on time and not long enough for the mask to be an issue. Food was good and the seat was comfortable. Can't be faulted.","976":"The call wait time when phoning qantas is pathetic. Every time I've called, it's taken 1h30 plus. How does Qantas continue to allow this? It's clear they are not bothered to improve their service.","977":"The last leg of my journey was from Brisbane to Adelaide. I had requested 2C as usual, but surprisingly I was moved to 3D. It was full, as there were so many Qantas staff on this flight. Alcohol was served from the bar, but I don\u2019t drink. I chose salad, but it wasn\u2019t nice. I have never enjoyed the food from the Brisbane catering.","978":"From Hervey Bay to Brisbane I was on a Qantas Link flight again. It was a short flight with only a few passengers. This time I didn\u2019t ask for tea as it would have strong taste of chlorine. I had two bottles of spring water, instead. I also took my own snack with me.","979":"After spending a couple of hours in the Brisbane Business Lounge, we went down to the lower level to board the Qantas Link flight to Hervey Bay. It was a short one-hour flight on a fine day. I couldn\u2019t drink tea, as the water had strong taste of chlorine. So the flight attendants gave me two bottles of spring water.","980":"I had to cancel my trip to Beijing 18 months ago because of the Covid border restrictions. So this was the first flight I took since then. I was glad to be able to donate to Unicef all the Chinese currency which I had never used. The Unicef donation box used to be a half way down towards the aerobridge, but it has moved to near the Qantas Club. I had a muffin, fruit salad, scrambled eggs and black tea for breakfast in the lounge. The food in the Adelaide lounge has always been very nice.\nUnfortunately I left my cushion in my friends car, when he dropped me off at the airport. As there were neither pillows nor blankets on board because of Covid, they gave me two sets of towels instead. That was very kind of them! For the refreshment on board I had a pasty and black tea. We had a smooth flight to Brisbane.","981":"Been a couple of years between flights with COVID and all. Arrived, checked in, boarded. All normal, Taxied out, powered up, cockpit alarm, nothing found, did a lap around Tulla, taxied out, powered up, same alarm. Returned to terminal to change planes. Not very reassuring.\nEventually got under way. Flight time is 3 hours plus. A cup of coffee doesn't cut it. Maybe they left the meal on the other plane. Grumpy crew, understandably.\n\nReturn Flight QF703. Flying back to Vic which was in lockdown. Had bid on an upgrade for 2. 21000 FF points. Was upgraded. Was served a meal although I found it very bland and unpleasant.\n\nOverall feel QANTAS has lost the plot somewhere. COVID? Maybe.","982":"You get used to Qantas being late, having grumpy attendants and stingy food. Well this flight was the opposite. We left early and arrived 20 minutes early. The young flight attendants were friendly and gave out extra pies and there was even free wine onboard. They did 2 drink runs! My only gripe was the lack of the entertainment app - why not on this 717 but it was available on the flight up?\n\nI don't often give Qantas 5 stars but this is deserved.","983":"The first flight on the way home was very empty and was 20 minutes early! That doesn't often happen on Qantas domestic services.\n\nWe had an exit row seat and used the free WiFi. This service had seat back screens as well and USB chargers.\n\nThe snack was dips and carrot sticks.","984":"The second leg of our flight was on a 737 and we got the exit row with the middle seat free between us. We had a slice for a snack which was OK. The entertainment app and free WiFi were on. Our bags came off quickly.","985":"We were on the early 6am flight from Hobart so enjoyed our breakfast in the Qantas Club. The plane left 20 minutes late. We like the 717 as it has pairs of seats down one side. The catering was a slice of banana bread and a cup of tea. A reasonable flight for Qantas. And the entertainment app was back on this flight at last!","986":"Having travelled with Qantas for years in business class and have always had exceptional service both on the flight and the lounge. I flew over to Australia a couple of weeks ago in business class and was disgusted, disappointed and appalled by the lack of service, quality of food and the lack of care.\nNow today I have spent hours on the phone trying to change my flights due to unforeseen circumstances. When I finally got through to a consultant, I was advised that I would have to pay for a new business flight home, total of $1000 each.\nNo longer offering the $179 fee to change my flight next week. When I disputed this with the consultant, my line was disconnected. When I called back I was on the phone for another 2 hours and had to finally stop trying due to other commitments.\nQantas, one day the world will return to travelling freely and your flights will be empty not due to COVID but due to your terrible \ud83d\ude22 customer service.","987":"Terrible I\u2019ve spent 4 hours now trying to get someone to answer the phone it is appalling service\nHow this can be a world class airline is beyond me","988":"I was on hold for over 1 hr after they said a 30min hold time wait regarding my layover from Christchurch to Sydney and then Sydney to Brisbane , poor effort. After seeing all the reviews I\u2019m second guessing","989":"I booked a direct flight to Coffs Harbour, to now be emailed to say I will now have a 4 hour wait in Sydney,.\nWhy advertise direct flights and then change it after I have paid.\nPoor effort Qantas","990":"They\u2019ve had over a year to get ready for passengers, now Qantas staff are more rude and unhelpful than ever before!","991":"Qantas customer service has taken a heavy nose dive.\n3hour + waits on hold to speak to someone about flights.\n\nMaybe Qantas should re-hire all the staff they terminated during covid to answer call centre phone calls.","992":"I pre COVID would only travel Qantas both for domestic and international, now they are the last airline I would choose.\nMy 2020 international flight got cancelled because of COVID, which is not the fault of qantas, but the months it took them to refund me was unacceptable.\nNow 2021 they have cancelled all my frequent fliers points, not my fault I was not able to travel , March I booked an airfare to NZ\/ The return flight was booked and confirmed Wellington to Sydney Direct, they have now changed it via Melbourne adding about 3 hours to the day. Not happy. But this was the last straw, after this flight I will never fly with them again as they are not to be trusted\n(Note this flight is to happen in July 2021 no opinion for that date)","993":"The worst lounge I have been to. I understand that the staff had to serve the food due to covid, however the food quality was terrible and servings were so small. Eggs were dry and hard, fruit salad looked like it has been there all week. For $80 for 2 people it was not worth it. Better to get a coffee and toastie in the food court.","994":"I live in Gold Coast and work in Melbourne and fly between cities weekly.\nI am a Platinum Qantas FF & usually fly Jeststar as they have the range of flexible flights.\n\nI have 55 trips between these destinations on Jetstar where i have purchased a Max Bundle which advertises Status Credits & FF points for Qantas FF members, however none of the points find their way to my account.\n\nI have used the site to claim the missing points and receive no response to claim.\nI have written 7 complaint emails to Qantas with the first 6 unanswered and finally a response to the 7th, but no satisfactory outcome.\n\nI have now referred the matter to the Office of Fair Trading as I do not believe Qantas\/Jetstar should advertise the points and status credits if they have no intention of awarding them.\n\nI am owed over 70,000 FF points but more importantly 1700 status credits which go toward life time Platinum status.","995":"I wholeheartedly recommend avoiding this company at all costs. No dramas with taking your money and if all goes well, but God forbid you need a refund. I have waited months and months of back and forth to no avail, several weeks between each reply where they don't even read what I've written and just throw a copy and paste that is of zero help and doesn't resolve anything. Then another few weeks before they do the same to my reply. Told me to get advice from the bank, I got it, provided it to them, and they did the exact opposite of what the bank suggested - refunding to an old account, which is no longer retrievable - so they have literally lost me several hundred dollars because they didn't take the advice they asked for. Have made me waste hours on numerous in person visits and phone calls with my bank, hours of wasteful messages, and all the while have zero empathy and zero recognition of their own mistake - and a complete refusal to even read a word I say and acknowledge what has happened. Must not have a copy and paste for that. They can't even, after months of asking, simply call me to discuss. They refuse to escalate and refuse to call me. Waste of time, waste of money, disgusting service. Would literally pay 10x as much for a flight through someone else simply to avoid this company who talk in circles and ignore everything I say. Steer clear especially in times like these where you are likely to have to deal with customer service. That's too generous a name for this team of thieves.","996":"SO Mr Joyce, You have been given millions of our tax dollars and when I call to make an urgent change due to the developing Covid-19 situation :\nA : I still cant get my call answered and have been on hold ow for 2hrs and 17 mins\nB: when I booked my flights they were able to be changed\n\nSO , when I go online you want me to pay another $85.00 for the same flight advertised at the SAME price I booked . I can get home with Virgin for $75.00 all up! SO check your pricing everyone.\n\nI have been a loyal Qantas frequent flyer , but will now move to Virgin.\nREASONS:\nVirgin is cheaper, answer their phones, are helpful and beside the snack there is absolutely no difference, so my suggestion is save money on the very same service\nAND after coming to Melbourne on a dirty plane with Qantas , they can't even keep that promise anymore","997":"we will definitely fly with Qantas again..plenty of helpful staff around both at Melbourne airport and at Darwin airport...check in went smoothly as well at both airports","998":"I normally love the peace and quiet of a Qantas Club lounge but find the lounge in Adelaide quite noisy and not conducive to relaxing before a flight. There is a distracting overall background soundtrack together with a number of noisy TV screens. We tried to find a quiet spot to read and chat but there was none. We were seated in the back corner beyond the bar but still had to contend with the competitive sounds of both the TV and the background music. Whilst I appreciate that some people like to watch TV in while waiting for their flights, and their presence in certain pockets of the room is probably non negotiable, surely we do not need to be subjected to a continuous music soundtrack as well over the entire floor?","999":"The flight crew were excellent, the food in business class was better than expected. BUT for the 2nd time in 2 trips we lost a bag. The flight was from Melbourne to Hamilton Is via Brisbane. Upon arrival In Hamilton Is only one of our 2 bags arrived. After numerous telephone calls the bag was eventually found to still be in Brisbane. Our stop over in Brisbane was 1.5 hrs - plenty of time to get the bags sorted. The bag belonged to my wife and Qantas provided and emergency kit - all male products! NOT helpful. We were told by people on the Island that this situation is not uncommon! We got our bag 24 hours later. It will make us seriously consider whether we continue to use Qantas, even though we have a lot of flying points. We do not need the stress."},"Date_of_travel":{"0":" July 2023","1":" July 2023","2":" July 2023","3":" July 2023","4":" July 2023","5":" June 2023","6":" June 2023","7":" February 2023","8":" June
